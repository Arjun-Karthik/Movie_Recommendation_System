Two groups of cousins from the same royal family, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, vie for control of the Kingdom. Although descended from two brothers who live in peace, Dhritarashtra and Pandu, the cousins' rivalry leads to death and destruction and jeopardizes the very fabric of the universe. Born blind, Dhritarashtra, the elder brother, sits on the throne. His sons, the Kauravas, led by the ambitious and envious Duryodhana, seek to maintain their hold on power. In contrast, Pandu's sons, the Pandavas, led by the righteous Yudhishthira, seek to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs, and nothing more. The conflict between the two families intensifies over time, fuelled by jealousy, greed, and betrayal. The story weaves through a rich tapestry of events, including an infamous game of dice in which Yudhishthira loses his kingdom and freedom. The Pandavas find themselves in exile until their eventual return to fight and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. After years of tension and conflict, the only possible resolution is a battle of epic proportions, in which warriors of unparalleled strength destroy each other in a clash over the fate of the kingdom. Led by the noble Arjuna and guided by the divine Krishna, the Pandavas face off against their cousins, teachers, and friends on the battlefield. The war is not merely a clash of armies but a moral and philosophical struggle, testing in each person the principles of righteousness and duty. In the end, the Pandavas emerge victorious, but victory comes at a heavy price. The war leaves behind a trail of destruction and loss, leaving them and us to question the very nature of victory and the true cost of power."
