This immense ecosystem, shaped for decades by industrial forestry, is revealed in all its fragility: vast monocultures of maritime pines, highly flammable, planted in the name of economic productivity. After the Fire investigates what comes next. Should we rebuild the same combustible model, ignoring the warnings of climate change? Or can this disaster become a turning point, an opportunity to imagine forests that are more diverse, more resilient, and more alive? Through striking images of regeneration and the voices of scientists, conservationists and local communities, the film opens a debate at the heart of our future: forests are no longer only a resource to be exploited, they are also our most vital allies against global warming. The documentary captures the silent rebirth of wetlands, the return of rare plants, and the fragile balance between human needs and ecological survival. It questions the legacy of industrial forestry, rooted in short-term profit, and contrasts it with the possibility of reinventing landscapes able to withstand drought, heat, and fire. Between urgency and hope, After the Fire reveals the intimate link between climate crisis and biodiversity, showing that in the ashes of catastrophe lies a chance for transformation. It is both a warning and an invitation: to rethink our relationship with forests, to learn from the fire, and to build a future where resilience replaces exploitation."

He worked at a factory for years before becoming the first wheelchair-bound insurance agent in Hong Kong.

Anacostia Delta: The Legacy of DC's TeleMasters,"In September of 2015, thirty local musicians took the stage at the legendary Birchmere Concert Hall in suburban Washington DC in front of a packed house to celebrate legendary guitar player Danny Gatton and the music scene he championed, a scene with a unique style that Gatton named the ""Anacostia Delta"" sound, after the river that runs through the region he called home. This unique documentary concert film captures that musical celebration and tells the story of a hugely influential music scene that spans nearly six decades in the nation's capitol. With Gatton as the introduction, the film is a journey deep into the roots of the Anacostia Delta sound-and a celebration of its vibrancy today. The film also honors other guitar heroes of the Anacostia Delta like the late Roy Buchanan who was also labeled ""the greatest unknown guitar player in the world."" Buchanan was a blues hero to millions and remains an inspiration to many. He mentored DC native and Bruce Springsteen's guitar player, Nils Lofgren. In the 70s, Roy found the DC world so complete that he turned down an invitation to join the Rolling Stones and an invitation to record with John Lennon. Here in DC he perfected his influential sound. Buchanan and Gatton both admired another DC player-a man of enormous influence and renown, but forgotten today, Chick Hall. In an interview, Chick Jr. shares how his father's eclectic and virtuosic playing amazed country legends like Roy Clark, Jimmy Dean and Patsy Cline in the 1950s when DC was considered a country music town. Chick Jr. and brother Chris take the stage with their down home soul-inflected country sound to pay homage. We find out that it was Chick Sr. who convinced 50's rock legend Link Wray (""the father of the power chord"" and inspiration to Townshend, Jimmy Page and Iggy Pop) to come to DC. As a young musician, Danny Gatton would end up playing on ""Fire and Brimstone,"" one of Wray's hits. Through interviews and stage performances, the film introduces audiences to current DC guitar virtuosos like Tom Principato, Dave Chappell, Dan Hovey, Rick Whitehead and Chuck Underwood who still have the passion to play the intoxicating mix of blues, jazz, bluegrass and country music that Gatton played to perfection. The film leaves the audience certain that the music of this DC scene has a bright future in players like Anthony Pirog, whose mastery-inspired by Gatton-is bringing him recognition in guitar circles around the world. As the concert progresses, each act, each tune takes us deeper and deeper into the rich tapestry of Gatton's beloved Anacostia Delta. The cheering crowd leaps to their feet at the show's close-proof positive that this unique DC scene is alive, vibrant as ever and ready to be introduced to the world."

Another Summer,"Afghanistan and Ukraine - what do they have in common? And what remains of humanity when conflict outbursts? Another Summer tells stories of Afghan and Ukrainian refugees in Europe through their perspective. It is a film by refugees about refugees - the directors of Another Summer provided training and equipment to a group of Afghan and Ukrainian first-time filmmakers who had taken refuge in different European countries after the Taliban takeover in 2021 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The filmmakers were divided into teams and sent to seven cities in Europe and Turkey. Their task was to record the stories of people like themselves who had fled violence and repression, capture what it nowadays means to be a refugee and gather unseen footage from their past lives and the horrors they endured. From what they brought back, one senses the bonds of people who recognize in each other what they have lost and the humanity they refuse to give up. Does it matter where you come from when you have to leave your home, what was yours has been stolen or destroyed, and your past has been stripped away?"

The deep chest voice brought with the experience is of course visible when discussing the making of the films, but also when he tells his own point of view about the current state of the Finnish cinema, the Finnish Film Foundation and the ""Finnish Oscars"", Jussi awards.

Her laptop sits on a shoebox, in the privacy of her home she finds first lines and harmonies: ""I like to be alone,"" one song begins. One by one, musicians join her. Intuitive ideas take shape. A window has opened. Arrangements, rehearsals, recordings follow. Step by step, the music enters public space, images are produced, videos, narratives. Questions arise: New beginning or back to the roots? New Biedermeier or tough political comment? The bigger the band, the riskier the booking. The more crisis-ridden the environment, the more comforting the music-making. Sabine Herpich shows the creation of a pop album as a working process. Her view is as unpretentious as her protagonist, her quiet observation not interested in story and glamour, but in closeness and comprehension. We understand why someone works as an artist, even if it is never explained.

"Bearing Witness, Native American Voices in Hollywood","For over 100 years, Hollywood cinema has crafted the ultimate ""villain""-the Indian, as they were labeled in early Westerns. Confined almost exclusively to this genre, the Western became a vehicle for American racism, obscuring the genocide upon which the United States was built. For more than four decades, these films glorified ""Manifest Destiny"" and the conquest of so-called ""wild"" lands, with little regard for those who stood in the way. It wasn't until the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s that a shift occurred. A new wave of films, such as Little Big Man and Soldier Blue, emerged, offering more authentic portrayals of Native Americans and acknowledging the horrific massacres they endured. In this documentary, only Native Americans are given a voice to share their story, one that has been overshadowed by Hollywood's portrayal. Their narrative, part of the larger American story, highlights how cinema has long been used as a powerful propaganda tool, distorting history and perpetuating harmful stereotypes."

Beelden van Piet Hein,"What should we do with the legacy of 17th century Dutch corsair Piet Hein? For ages, his capture of the Spanish Silver Fleet was celebrated in school songs, but now his actions are increasingly viewed through the lens of colonial criticism. Does he still deserve a statue? Or perhaps even a taller pedestal? And what should be written on the accompanying plaque? In the documentary Elevating Piet Hein: the Monumental Myth of a Dutch Corsair, director Tim van den Hoff humorously exposes the discomfort that officials grapple with as they try to preserve their heritage. Not much is actually known about Piet Hein himself, but that doesn't stop both supporters and critics from appropriating him and interpreting him in their own ways. In the search for a broadly accepted text for the monument of Hein in Rotterdam's Delfshaven, the city is organizing an emotion-networking session. Participants awkwardly move around Piet Hein's grand statue. 'He doesn't look like someone worthy of carrying a sword,' remarks a critical speaker. The simultaneous restorations of Piet Hein's national monument in his birthplace Rotterdam-Delfshaven, his grave monument in the Old Church in Delft, and a statue in Matanzas, Cuba (where the capture of the Silver Fleet took place) offer a glimpse into the peculiar world of heritage and hero-worship, showing how the myth of Piet Hein, nearly 400 years after his death, continues to live on. From commemorative coins to the reverence of Hein's remains, from 19th-century nationalistic statues to the unlikely friendship between a Rotterdam scrap dealer and Fidel Castro-director Tim van den Hoff lightheartedly but incisively portrays the tantalizing relationship with our colonial past, accompanied by music from composer Ernst Reijseger, performed by the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and the Marine Band of the Royal Netherlands Navy."

Behind the Face,"'Bahurupee' is a primitive form of folk-theatre, found predominantly in West Bengal, which has a long heritage over 300 years. In Sanskrit language 'Bahu' means many and 'Rup' means form; thus, the meaning of ""Bahurupee' is the art of taking on many forms. The artistes, who are practicing the art of 'bahurupee, masquerade themselves as gods or beasts or demons or normal characters - like saints or madman, etc. With the help of these guises they amuse people and earn their livelihood. Once it was time when almost in every rural locality of Bengal, the Bahurupee artists were found. But now the situation is different. Only few artistes are found in small areas of Bengal. Tawdry dress and colourful makeup cannot obliterate the actual tragedy of their poverty and decline. Tears often mingle with their fake smile. In this documentary, travelling along the road of history, it is tried to draw a map as well as analyse, from the socio-economic angle, the rise and fall of this ancient folk form of Bengal."

Benvenuti in galera,"Filmed over three years, Benvenuti In Galera is the documentary film that tells the story of the world's first restaurant opened inside a penal institution. Located at the Milan Bollate Prison, In Galera restaurant is a concrete example of social reintegration of inmates. What makes it unique is not only the high-quality dining experience it offers, but above all the stories of those who work there. Indeed, In Galera is a place where the stories of different people in prison intersect, each with their own experience and perspective. For some inmates, working in the kitchen or hall means more than just having a temporary occupation. It is a chance to prove their ability to keep up with professional standards in the industry, acquire new skills and demonstrate their ability to work as part of a team. In this sense, In Galera also represents an opportunity for redemption for those who have made mistakes in the past. But the restaurant is not only a place of work for inmates, it is also a way for the outside community to get in touch with prison reality in a new and different way. It thus becomes a bridge between the prison and the outside world, a place where social and cultural differences can be overcome through the sharing of a common passion: quality food. In summary, In Galera represents a project of great social value, able to offer an opportunity of redemption to inmates and to bring the outside community closer to the prison reality."

Hoetger zählt zur Avantgarde des frühen 20. Jahrhunderts. Zahlreiche Mäzene kann er für sich gewinnen. So lässt Ludwig Roselius von ihm Teile der Bremer Böttcherstraße entwerfen.

Blowing in the Wind,"It's 2013, two years after the initially peaceful uprising that led to the Syrian civil war, and a group of citizen soldiers are advancing from their hometown of Saraqeb to Al-Tabqa Military Airport, Raqqa to fight Bashar al-Assad's army. In his 2018 film, The Greatest Sacrifice, director Eyad Aljarod showed how a group of Syrian friends became armed combatants following the events of 2011. In this behind-the-scenes documentary he takes a new angle on the same war. Here, Aljarod films a citizen militia on hazardous combat operations in the war zone and during the firing of rocket launchers. But more often than the fighting itself, he captures the men in the moments in between: drinking tea around a fire, working out strategies, discussing logistical issues and kicking a ball around. They form a close brotherhood, despite occasional discord around their experiences of religious faith. Without interviews or commentary, Aljarod captures an insider's view on the everyday mundanity of a war spanning many years. We may not see the victims of war, or even much violence, but the enduring tension, sadness and fighting spirit remain palpable."

Bluff City Chinese,"Bluff City Chinese is a powerful documentary following the intertwined journeys of two Chinese-American storytellers from different generations, who come together to recover and share the untold history of Chinese immigrants in Memphis, Tennessee. Directed by Thandi Cai (Anna) and featuring their mentor and Delta Chinese elder, Emerald Dunn, the film dives into the layered and challenging process of reconstructing a community's history from the ground up. Set against a backdrop of social and racial tensions, Cai and Dunn work to build an authentic record of Memphis's Chinese community, navigating profound questions of identity, belonging, and intergenerational understanding along the way. The story begins with parallel narratives: Emerald Dunn's extensive historical research, which has documented Chinese experiences in the South, and Cai's own return to Memphis in 2020. Brought together by the Chinese Historical Society during a time of increased anti-Asian sentiment nationwide, they share a sense of urgency to reclaim the voices of the past. Drawing on Dunn's independently gathered archives of photographs, genealogical records, and news clippings, they embark on a journey beyond personal discovery, inviting others from the Chinese Memphian community-ages 15 to 92-to share their stories. These conversations result in 28 collected oral histories, forming a rich 150-year long patchwork of stories and to spin a tapestry of memories, hopes, and dreams. The two storytellers then take the audience to explore the untold narratives of Chinese settlers in the Mississippi Delta. By guiding viewers through their journey, from the Main Library to historic Elmwood Cemetery and everything that happened in-between, this film invites you to reflect on the past, connect with the present, and consider the future of Chinese-American heritage in the American South. By telling this history, Cai and Dunn forge an intergenerational bond that bridges distinct upbringings and perspectives, shaped by shared experiences of fear, hope, and pride as Chinese Americans in Memphis. Reflecting this diversity, the documentary team includes first- through fourth-generation Chinese Memphians, all dedicated to capturing the community's complex and evolving identity. At its core, Bluff City Chinese is a tribute to the Chinese Memphis community-a powerful testament to how storytelling, tradition, and a shared vision for the future can bring generations together. As Cai and Dunn explore what it means to preserve their community's legacy, they reveal the resilience of a people reclaiming their narrative, ultimately offering an inspiring call for unity, identity, and the passing of wisdom from one generation to the next."
Blum - Gospodari svoje buducnosti,"After World War II, in the devastated, rural Bosnia and Herzegovina, entrepreneur Emerik Blum created a large and successful company ""Energoinvest"" that operated worldwide with billions of dollars in profit.

Calico Rebellion,"In the lush woods of New York's Catskill Mountains, a mythical memory lives on. Of a time when men - armed with rifles and pitchforks, disguised in eerie leather masks and calico gowns - descended from the hills to stage the ""Second American Revolution"". Two hundred years ago immigrant farmers in the Catskills, fed up with oppression and exploitation by absentee landlords, staged a rebellion known as the Anti-Rent War. The uprising changed the course of history, paving the way to land rights across America and to the formation of a new political group - Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party. Today, although largely forgotten, the historic uprising lives on through direct descendants of those rebellious farmers. CALICO REBELLION explores a pivotal moment in American history, and a community's unique and enduring connection to the past through the songs, stories and costumes preserved from the 1840s. Part historical ""true crime"" story - part meditation on land and belonging in America - CALICO REBELLION is a meditation on small town American history, identity, idealism and the violence that percolates beneath the surface."

Can You See Me the Documentary,"Can You See Me is not just a documentary-it's a mirror held up to America, asking an urgent, uncomfortable question: when you look at a Black man, do you really see him? At its core, this film is a collection of real stories from Black men who are tired-tired of being followed in stores, pulled over without cause, and walking through life under a cloud of suspicion. But beneath that exhaustion is something even deeper: a longing to be seen as sons, fathers, leaders, and human beings. With honesty and vulnerability, Can You See Me captures the inner lives of men who rarely get to tell their truth without being interrupted, dismissed, or redefined by someone else's fears. Sparked by the collective grief surrounding George Floyd's death, the film creates a space for healing, reflection, and accountability. Through raw interviews and intimate visuals, we hear from men of all walks of life-artists, educators, pastors, and young fathers-each sharing what it means to exist in a world where they are too often seen as threats before they are seen as people. The documentary doesn't rely on stats or soundbites. Instead, it listens. It slows down. It gives Black men the room to take off the emotional armor they wear daily and speak from a place of truth. They talk about fear-not just of violence, but of not making it home to their kids. They speak about love-the kind that shows up in protection, guidance, and presence. And they share what strength looks like when the world demands it constantly but rarely supports it. Can You See Me challenges viewers to sit in the discomfort of their own assumptions and invites them to look deeper. Because once you truly see someone-not the image, not the label, but the soul-you can't unsee it. And maybe, just maybe, that's where change begins. This film is a tribute, a reckoning, and a call to finally see what's been in front of us all along"

Captain Carnival,"The giant allegoric floats of Viareggio, Tuscany, are ironic, dramatic, and fabulous metaphors of papier-mâché, hinting at the big themes of the day. Every year, since almost a century and a half, they parade along the promenade, like black and white movie monsters, higher than the highest art nouveau buildings of this tourist resort flourished at the turn of the 19th century, when the Carnival festival itself was born, destined to become one of the most popular in Europe. In the Covid-19 age, in an atmosphere suspended between hope and doubt, the ""carristi"" - the craftsmen who build the biggest and most animated Carnival floats of the world - were getting ready to take off again for the 2022 festival, that was supposed to have more than ever a symbolic meaning of regeneration, and to celebrate the value historically most cherished by the town of Viareggio: freedom. But Covid is raging and the carnival, if it is ever celebrated, will still be among a thousand limitations that will distort the party again, like last year. Now, more than ever, the carristi appear just like they usually appear to their little fans - superheroes of the papier-mâché. Or captains of a ship - the float - that must be brought at all costs, and maybe for the last time, to destination. And no one remembers why."

Claim the Sky: We Shall Overcome,"Plot Summary - Claim the Sky: We Shall Overcome When author and music producer Isaias Gamboa stumbles upon a little-known family story about a gospel hymn possibly connected to the Civil Rights Movement, he sets out on what becomes a decade-long quest to uncover the truth behind We Shall Overcome-a song hailed by the U.S. Library of Congress as ""the most powerful song of the 20th century."" What begins as a simple investigation soon unravels into a stunning exposé. Gamboa discovers that the world has been misled for over 60 years into believing that folk singer Pete Seeger and others wrote the anthem. In reality, the song's true author was Louise Shropshire, an African American hymn writer, gospel composer, and close friend of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Through a paper trail of copyrights, letters, and suppressed history, Gamboa traces how Shropshire's original gospel composition-If My Jesus Wills-was appropriated, rebranded, and falsely copyrighted by Seeger and his music publisher, The Richmond Organization. As the investigation deepens, Gamboa interviews key witnesses and cultural icons-Otis Williams, Pat Boone, Pete Seeger, and Lee Daniels-and uncovers never-before-seen photos, sermons, and documents that link Shropshire directly to the birth of We Shall Overcome as we know it. The plot intensifies when Gamboa leads the We Shall Overcome Foundation into a federal courtroom, filing a lawsuit to expose the fraudulent copyright claims that kept Shropshire's name hidden for decades. In a dramatic legal showdown, Gamboa challenges the legacy of an American folk hero and the powerful music publishing system that stood to profit. Part musical odyssey, part historical detective story, Claim the Sky: We Shall Overcome is a sweeping narrative of truth, justice, and cultural reclamation. As it culminates in a 2018 court ruling that places We Shall Overcome back into the public domain, the film delivers a powerful message: that even the most sacred songs must sometimes be fought for-and that history, when reclaimed, can still sing."

Although Nils has been a master of his craft for years, he never pursued it professionally. He opted instead to work with Bryggeriet, the organization that is the heartbeat of the Malmö skate scene. So on the side of developing skate-parks, contests, spots and a relationship with the city council, he also managed to take time to document Malmö's legendary DIY spots, parks and the skaters that emerged from these spots such as Pontus Alv, Oski and many more. While Nils photographic talents took him further afield to shoot campaigns for shoe brands and projects with Polar, he always remained rooted in Malmö. It is here today, where he finds himself questioning his relevance. Nils recently turned 50 and although he is well respected he finds himself doubting his involvement in a traditionally young culture. Will he hang up his camera after three decades or will his friend's convince him to keep on going?"

Code of Fear,"The fruit of long reflection and a personal quest for understanding, this essential documentary aims to highlight the discrimination suffered by gay people in Cameroon, where same-gender sexual orientation is considered a crime and is punishable by law, with a maximum sentence of six years in prison. In 2013, the young journalist Eric Lembembe was murdered in Cameroon. He was tortured and beaten to death because he was gay and had fought for gay rights. Shocked by this gruesome murder in his home country, filmmaker Appolain Siewe sets off for Cameroon to find out more about the situation of LGBTQI+ people there. He soon realizes that Lembembe's murder is no isolated case. Same-gender sexual orientation is still a criminal offense in Cameroon, as it is in almost all African countries. Being gay is completely taboo and is considered an embarrassment for families. While making the film, Siewe examines his own homophobic upbringing and seeks contact with members of his family. Since living in Europe, his outlook has changed. For his father, on the other hand, making a film on the subject is enough for him to break off all contact. Why is homophobia so firmly anchored in Cameroon's society? What role does colonization have to play in this? Siewe's own experiences, moving encounters with activists who fight for tolerance in their country despite all the risks, and his conversations with Cameroonian scientists, sociologists, and human rights activists offer a comprehensive insight into society in Cameroon."

In 2022 they decide to take this music to reconnect and heal through live concerts and ultimately bring the conversation of care to the most important global conference on gender equality at the UN headquarters in New York, celebrating resilience and speaking through their artistic voices to transform. Through intimate testimonies of the musicians, archival footage, animation by Syrian artist Kevork Mourad and scenes filmed by filmmakers Marta Ferrer and Pedro González Rubio, the documentary portrays this process of creation, going through the songs of Con Alma in a journey that goes from the memories and sensations of isolation to the reunions and celebration of life and friendship.

Con l'aiuto di Dio,"Con l'aiuto di Dio tells the extraordinary story of Mosè Bordero, a 94-year-old man driven by a lifelong dream to construct a leudo-a traditional Ligurian sailing vessel with ancient origins, known for its distinctive, sturdy structure. Despite his advanced age and the skepticism of others, Mosè has dedicated over a decade to this arduous project, crafting the vessel with his bare hands and defying obstacles in his small Italian coastal town of Casarza Ligure. The documentary unfolds over the course of Mosè's birthday, revealing the challenges and small victories of his monumental endeavor. As Mosè reflects on his journey, viewers gain insight into the resilience, faith, and unwavering determination that fuel his work. Through intimate interviews with Mosè, his family, and community members, we see not only his impressive physical effort but also his profound emotional and spiritual connection to the sea, a passion cultivated over a lifetime spent on the water. Mosè's pursuit of this dream is a testament to hope, tradition, and the human spirit's capacity for persistence. The film beautifully captures the world of a man who stands as a local hero, embodying values of courage, heritage, and continuity. In following Mosè's story, Con l'aiuto di Dio offers an inspiring message that resonates universally: it is never too late to chase one's dreams, even those that seem impossible, as long as one has faith and determination. ""Life isn't just about what's real; it's built on dreams. We should see Moses' Leudo as the last of its kind, a vessel that will never stop sailing our seas."" A sailor."

Condor Canyon,"Condor Canyon dives deep into the lives of three mating pairs of California condors among others, documenting their struggles against natural and man-made threats in the rugged terrains of central California. Set in Big Sur, California and filmed at Pinnacles National Park, this film narrates the condors' fight against wildfires, lead poisoning, and the heartbreaking challenges of reproduction influenced by the pesticide, DDT. Stunningly filmed in Ultra High Definition, the film follows ""Traveler"" (Red 71) as she overcomes lead poisoning, while her mate, ""Shadow"" (Yellow 9), cares for their chick alone-balancing fatherhood with maintaining his status as the flock's alpha. Meanwhile, a rival condor, ""Amigo"" (Yellow 4), challenges the hierarchy, forcing Shadow to defend his dominance. Traveler has struggled to lay normal eggs throughout her life due to the past use of the pesticide DDT. Although banned today, the pesticide persists in the environment. Condors feeding on contaminated marine mammals such as California sea lions, are at risk of accumulation and laying thinned eggs, and Traveler appears to have had more trouble laying viable eggs than other condors in the flock. Ultimately, Traveler and her mate, Shadow, were successfully raising a chick together when Traveler ingested lead from a carcass contaminated with lead ammunition. Conservationists quickly captured and treated her at the zoo, leading to a long and challenging recovery at both the Oakland and Los Angeles Zoos. After her recovery, she was re-released into the wild. Miraculously, both Traveler and her chick survived and were reunited. Lead poisoning is the leading cause of death in wild condors, which occurs when feeding on carcasses shot with lead bullets left behind in the field. Excessive mortality, above all else, is the reason for the condors near extinction. Conservationists such as those from the Ventana Wildlife Society, along with zoos, are working hard to recover the condor back to the wild, free of human intervention. Both spent lead bullets and pesticide DDT are contaminants found in the food condors eat. A wild population of condors exists due to ongoing releases of captive-bred condors. Condor Canyon was created by Ventana Wildlife Society, a non-profit organization working to restore the condor to the wild in central California. The film is beautifully narrated by Catherine Cavadini, a veteran voice artist renowned for her work in countless animated films and as the original voice of Blossom in The Powerpuff Girls. This project was meticulously crafted to tell the condor story-from the opening music, featuring an excerpt from John Wineglass's dynamic symphony Big Sur: The Night Sun, to stunning visuals and exceptional archival footage. A story of loss and resilience, Condor Canyon offers a rare glimpse into the world of condors, highlighting their natural behaviors in the wild while offering a hopeful vision for their future."

Deep State Gangsters,"Deep State Gangsters is a full-length feature documentary that exposes the abuse of state power by the United States national security establishment, also known as the Deep State. This unique cinematic experience pulls back the curtain on this shadowy world. It features a captivating cast of characters and unveils a bureaucratic machine that destroys dissent to preserve its power. The cast of characters includes two CIA and two FBI whistleblowers who provide their firsthand experiences of blowing the whistle and receiving retribution for their efforts to hold the Deep State accountable for violations of laws. John C. Kiriakou: John served in the Central Intelligence Agency from 1990 to 2004, first as an analyst and later as a counterterrorism operations officer. He became the sixth whistleblower indicted by the Obama administration under the Espionage Act-a law designed to punish spies. John served twenty-three months in prison as a result of his revelations, which included disclosures on the CIA's use of torture against prisoners. He was targeted for prosecution by the Director of the CIA, John Brennan, in an act of vindictiveness that abused state power against a lawful whistleblower protected by the law. In the film, John provides firsthand commentary on his experiences as a CIA officer and whistleblower. Pedro Israel Orta: Pedro served in the Central Intelligence Agency from 2000 to 2018 as an analyst, operations officer, counterintelligence officer, technical targeting officer, deputy chief of base in a warzone, and technical operations officer. Orta served as an inspector in the Office of the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community and multiple war zone tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other undisclosed locations-earning eight exceptional performance awards. But he was fired one year shy of retirement after numerous rounds of reprisals for blowing the whistle. Pedro walks the viewer through his story as a CIA officer and whistleblower. Garret O'Boyle: Garret bravely stepped forward as a Congressional whistleblower disclosing FBI abuses of power. His journey began as an infantryman in the United States Army, where he courageously served multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, earning the esteemed Combat Infantryman's Badge. Garret exemplified dedication to his country as part of the 25th Infantry Division and the storied 101st Airborne Division. Transitioning to a new chapter post-military, he joined the FBI as a Special Agent, continuing his commitment to service. However, his allegiance to truth led him to make protected disclosures to Congress, resulting in unjust retaliation from within his agency. Despite facing suspension without pay, Garret remains resolute - a devoted Christian, husband, and father-undaunted by the challenges he confronts. Garret relives the trauma he suffered as e tells his deeply moving personal story. Nate Cain: Nate's civil rights were trampled through the FBI's unconstitutional surveillance and raiding of his home, confiscating his personal property, and victimizing his family through intimidation and a vicious smear campaign that lasted five years. The FBI also leaked his identity to the press with misinformation in an attempt to destroy his reputation and silence him. It was all a sham investigation to cover for the profoundly corrupt Clinton machine. Nate provides a shocking exposure of the FBI's abuses of power to silence him for his bold move to blow the whistle. Two color commentators provide expert analysis of perils of the abuse of power by the Deep state and what it means for our nation. J Michael Waller: Michael is the author of ""Big Intel: How the CIA and FBI Went from Cold War Heroes to Deep State Villains."" Big Intel recounts the dramatic story of the rise and Cold War heroics of the FBI and the American intelligence apparatus, followed by its unfortunate slide into Marxist-influenced Deep State dysfunction as BIG INTEL became BAD INTEL. Michael provides expert commentary on a Deep State run amok. Lee Smith: Lee Smith is a veteran journalist whose work appears in Tablet, Real Clear Investigations, and The Federalist. He's worked in media for thirty years, writing about national politics, foreign policy, and the press. Lee is the author of ""The Permanent Coup: How Enemies Foreign and Domestic Targeted the American President."" He provides expert commentary on the weaponization of government power to silence dissent."

Seine Frau Ruth wird denunziert und in Auschwitz ermordet. Den Söhnen sagt er, sie sei in einem Sanatorium gestorben und fortan verschwindet sie im Nebel einer ohnmächtigen Verdrängung.

Die Mutigen 56 - Deutschlands längster Streik,"The docudrama brings a unique labor dispute to life. Today, continued payment of wages in the event of illness is a matter of course. But workers in the 1950s, unlike employees, received no pay for the first three days of illness and then very little. The workers no longer want to put up with this unequal treatment. Through the lives of Emma and Alfred Freese, a fictional working-class family from Kiel, the challenges of that time are brought to life in all their harshness. Emma is a typical housewife and mother of that time. This time of hardship is seen through her eyes and the Freeses' struggle for a life of dignity is followed. The war and its deprivations have left their mark on this generation, but now things are looking up again. But when her husband Alfred collapses ill at the Howaldtswerft shipyard in Kiel, Emma despairs. He has to take it easy, but how is the family supposed to get by without wages? This cannot go on. In October 1956, up to 34,000 metal workers in the shipyards and factories of Schleswig-Holstein went on strike in the fight for justice and dignity. To this day, this strike is considered the longest in Germany. Employers and politicians stood in the way of the strikers with decisive force. On the employer side of the then booming shipbuilding industry was shipyard boss A. Westphal. Julius Bredenbeck, Herbert Sührig and Hein Wadle are well-known trade unionists to this day, having orchestrated the strike and led it to success."

Doomsday Rehearsal,"Plot Synopsis ""DOOMSDAY REHEARSAL"" is a feature documentary that follows Zaid Mastou, a Syrian-American journalist, as he embarks on a desperate mission to Türkiye following the devastating earthquake day of February 2023, where he learns that the home of his sister and mother's five-story building is turned to rubble. Zaid's urgent departure from Washington, D.C. takes him across continents, landing in Türkiye, facing treacherous conditions, including a severe snowstorm from the north that forces him to spend extra hours freeing his car from the snow. Despite the challenges, he continues on, enduring a 20-hour drive to Antakya in the south, the disaster's epicenter, where he is met with overwhelming grief and destruction. Once in Antakya, Zaid is caught between two identities: the son, driven by the need to find his mother beneath the rubble, and the war correspondent, compelled to document the devastation around him. As Zaid joins rescue efforts, helping transport the deceased to cemeteries, his affliction merges with the collective suffering of the nation. The sheer scale of death and destruction overwhelms him, and he realizes that his own story, however heartbreaking, is just one of thousands. In a city transformed into chaotic workshop of rescue and recovery, excavators tirelessly dig through the rubble, paramedics swarm the streets, and ambulances move endlessly between crumbled buildings, overwhelmed hospitals, and overcrowded cemeteries. Rows of black body bags awaiting burial becomes a grim routine to witness, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of Doomsday rehearsal. Amidst the devastation, Zaid confronts the fragility of of life and death, questioning profoundly the essence of human existence. Among the most heart wrenching stories that Zaid encounters is that of Abu Nayef, Zaid's mother's neighbor who clings to the hope of finding his wife and three children alive, including his five-month-old son. Alongside his surviving son-who was working in another city during the earthquake- Abu Nayef await with anguish. Abu Nayef is one of thousands of Syrians who fled the war, running from death, and now facing another adversity. Zaid's brother, Loukman, assists Abu Nayef with logistics and emotional support during the agonizing wait. Together, they stand in the shadow of the crumbled buildings, watching and hoping as rescue teams dig through the ruins. Amid this tragedy, Zaid's mission expands beyond his initial goal of finding his mother. He becomes a witness to the stories of others, documenting their pain and uncertainty. His lens focuses on the people trapped in this liminal space between life and death. Zaid's journalistic instincts take over, and he feels responsible for sharing these stories with the world. His documentation of the rescue operations becomes a critical archive of human suffering and resilience in the face of disaster. Time moves slowly; night and day cycles alternate for those waiting, and the audience is drawn into the unbearable tension of not knowing. As the hours pass, the impending doom grows, yet a tiny flicker of hope remains alive in those hearts. Then, the inevitable news about Abu Nayef's family arrives, marking a pivotal moment in his life. The camera follows him closely during these powerful, emotional hours, capturing his every reaction. It remains with him throughout the day, chronicling his journey through unforgettable moments until the night falls, and he finally retires to sleep, exhausted by the weight of his loss. Next morning, Zaid, Loukman, Abu Nayef, and his son appear in Gaziantep. Zaid finally reunites with his sister Hala, who survived the earthquake. The camera shifts its focus to an unexpected and poignant moment as Abu Nayef returns to work-a reminder that life must go on even after such a monumental loss. In these moments, the film explores the quiet courage of those who can move forward despite the devastation around them. DOOMSDAY REHEARSAL is a film produced by Zaid Mastou, his first film through his production company, to commemorate the 55 thousand earthquake victims."

However, as often occurs in observational documentary cinema, this served merely as a starting point for the film.

These arrangements, born out of financial necessity, highlight the struggles of individuals whose relationships have withered over time, yet who must endure living together due to economic constraints. Pooling their pensions becomes essential for covering basic living expenses such as food, heating, and utilities. At the heart of this story is Mara, a woman who has had several husbands. One tragically deceased, the other died otherwise. Her last companion, Ivars, whom she never officially married, became her partner for 24 years. Though their relationship had long lost its spark, they remained bound together by the need to survive."

Fragments of Ice captures both the broad sweep of history and the impact of this on the lives of real people, ending with a new upheaval - the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Darryl was raised in and taught the street hustle game at an early age, by the most noteworthy street legend in the history of the Bay Area, Felix Mitchell.

Darryl and his crew would later become an off-shoot version of the 69th Village MOB, which stood for My Other Brother. At the age of 13, Darryl witnessed the older members of the MOB being brought down by the FBI. Later that night he learned that Felix was also arrested. Within months after the arrest of the older members of the MOB, a new drug called crack-cocaine came to the forefront of America's problems and Oakland and Darryl Reed were in the middle of it. Darryl was introduced to the cocaine sales game by his friend, Rick and the two boys invested in the drug. The rest is what they say legends are made of, money, power and women.

Honeydew,"Honeydew, a remote mountainous corner in California, was converted to a refuge during the late 1970s for a group of people yearning for a life of freedom, without restrictions.

They have done this to circumvent patriarchal structures, to avoid misogynistic attacks, to support the family economically, to avoid compelled marriage and to be free. Our characters communicate with us intimately as they talk about their lives and bring us closely into their personal journey. They speak about freedom and oppression, about the promise of sacrificing their lives for the sake of their families' survival. But also about the breaking of gender barriers and the power of the human mind to decide who we want to be. The film turns stereotypes and projections of gender discussions upside down. The Burneshas expand our awareness of human life and its universal conditions but in the end their story shows that the essences of life, which are identified as female, are held as less valuable, even less worth living.

Huaquero,"On the northern coast of Ecuador, on Tolita Island, dozens of Afro-Ecuadorian children gather on the beach to collect Pre-Colombian artifacts that are scattered across the sand. They are all searching through the debris for pieces that they can somehow fix and sell to tourists on the mainland. Washo, a fifty-year-old unemployed fisherman, watches the children at their work while he recovers from a hangover. His fractured relationship with his daughter Yessica (6 years old) creates a distance between them. He leaves her with his ex-wife, who is upset with him for his irresponsibility as father. In the tropical heat of the night, Washo tries to fit the pieces of a clay figure back together like a puzzle. The scant catch of the season and the poor sales from his coconut grove only earn him enough to buy a bottle of moonshine and go out to the town's only bar on the makeshift docks, where the lights flicker thanks to the shortage of electricity. The alcohol and the precariousness of his life bring out his violent personality, which ends up permanently damaging his relationship with his daughter's mother. The sound of the waves breaking on the rocks of Isla DE la Plata (Silver Island) merges with the sounds of a boat from which Joselito (60 years old) descends. He is a native of the Ecuadorian coast and is dealing with the disappointment of the huaqueros (tomb raiders) who are complaining about the lack of results; they haven't found anything in the place where he suggested they excavate. Upon returning to the mainland, we can see how Joselito's museum has been destroyed by the recent earthquake. His brother urges him to sell all of his artifacts; thanks to the earthquake they need to rebuild their house and take care of their sick mother. But he refuses, confident that they will be able to find more pieces to sell. Excavating in another rural area of Valdivia, surrounded by a thick dry forest, an unexpected accident traps one of the huaqueros underground, and he suffocates to death. Impacted by the loss and limited by his lack of resources, Joselito sells off everything in his museum to a business magnate in the big city. After the deal is done, in which he practically has to give away his most valuable pieces for a laughable sum, he wanders through the city feeling lost, watching a backhoe digging a giant hole to build a new building. The trees begin to thin out in the arid landscape of Sipán, in northern Peru. Filo (50 year old) is talking to his lawyer who, through great legal maneuvering, has managed to get him out of prison, even though he has refused to admit anything about the robbery of El Señor DE Sipán (The Lord of Sipán), one of the greatest archeological finds in history, at the hands of huaqueros. After his time in prison Filo wanders like a ghost in his own home; his wife and son suffer the beatings of his depression, which has greatly deteriorated his relationship at home. He tries to support his family through his work in the sugarcane fields and in the little field of corn that he has beside the Mochica pyramid, where a great treasure was found years ago. But his efforts are in vain; the sugarcane company withholds his wages and he loses his own farm to an illegal fire. Tempted by necessity, he accepts the invitation of his friend who brings him to raid a tomb, insisting he knows the location of a new Moche treasure. Despite his wife's protests, he brings his son with him. After several hours of fruitless digging, a dozen police officers flood the camp and catch them red-handed. Once at the police station, Filo sees his lawyer again, who looks at him with disappointment when seeing that this time he has gotten his son involved. The desert spills infinitely in front of the ocean. The three giant pyramids of the archeological complex ""Huaca del Brujo"" (The Sorcerer's Tomb) pose motionless against the landscape. Juan helps his pregnant wife to gather mollusks at low tide. There is tension between them; what they earn will not be enough for what is coming next in their lives. At night Juan tries to catch crabs with his friends, but only manages to gather a few kilos. Roberto, an experienced huaquero from Magdalena DE Cao, Peru, invites Juan to help with a robbery. They walk together, posing as tourists as they examine the artifacts of the Sorcerer's Tomb, exploring its structure and its possible discoveries. At night, they approach the undefended tomb to excavate. But they are greatly surprised when, upon finding the treasure, a sun lights them up completely, turning the night into day. They escape with a few things and upon returning home, Juan finds his wife on the floor, covered in blood. Meanwhile Robert begins to have nightmares thanks to a crown of feathers he has stolen; in the morning, disturbed, he takes his motorbike and rides to the beach. Furiously he pours gasoline on all the loot and sets it on fire. He watches statically as everything burns in front of the ocean. ""Huaquero"" ventures down the South American coast, unearthing people and places that are apparently unconnected, but united by the precarious activity of selling archaeological artifacts from their ancestral cultures. Beginning in the lush equatorial jungle and ending in the desert landscape of the Peruvian coast, the film explores a masculinity torn apart by the necessity and the insanity of being forced to raid tombs in order to try to get ahead, and failing. The rural mood and its legends of the huaqueros filter throughout all the stories, and through the light that appears to leave them continuously in oblivion. The rawness of the documentation mixes with the fantasy of the mythological and poetic countryside, where it appears that the ancestors still speak of their pain through the holes inflicted on their sacred places, their ""huacas"" or tombs."

Mr. Zhang claims that in 1985, he was taken from his home by aliens and spent a month living on an alien planet, where he toured the planet and received knowledge through a scan technology used by the aliens. After returning from the alien planet, Mr. Zhang began writing letters to various physics institutes, relevant scientific organizations, and universities. The earliest letter dates back to 1991, but he received no response, only a few rejection letters. Undeterred, Mr. Zhang started teaching himself mathematics and physics, translating the knowledge from the alien planet into Earth's languages, and claims to have formulated a theory that encompasses the four fundamental forces of Earth-Unified Field Theory. With a skeptical attitude, we visited and filmed Mr. Zhang. When we first met him, we found it incredible that a rural man was fluent in advanced physics and mathematics, presenting a logically coherent system.

If I Could Tell You,"Charu, a Deaf woman and her hearing friend Surbhi share two very distinct relationships with Indian Sign Language (ISL) - Surbhi who is a child of Deaf adults (CODA) learnt sign even before she learnt any spoken language while Charu grew up in a family of hearing people and learnt ISL much later in life. Equipped with the power of language and the newfound access it has enabled her, Charu is trying to push the limits that the hearing world has imposed on her and is actively working towards building a larger community of independent, empowered Deaf women in India. Through her feminist forum called, ""Deaf Women Too"", she aims to reshape societal perspectives and create a more inclusive future. Surbhi, on the other hand has been an interpreter all her life, bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and hearing worlds. While continuing to fulfill her role as an interpreter, she is now learning to break out of the weight that comes with being a caregiver and is finding what it means to do something for herself. By opening up this conversation about the need to express beyond just the Deaf community, 'If I could Tell You' embarks upon a broader inquiry into the significance of language in our shared human experience. Interspersed with performances and interviews with a dancer, a drag queen, an actor and an ISL poet, the film explores how these various manifestations of visual language help us understand agency, autonomy and care. This documentary pushes the boundaries of storytelling by blending diverse media forms, including animation and artistic performances. It is also the first instance of an Indian film featuring an original ISL poem by a Deaf poet."

Ignatius - der Gottsucher,"Have you ever wondered what moves the Jesuits at their core? This innovative animated documentary about the founder of the Jesuits reveals his inner quest for God, and invites you to become a spiritual seeker yourself. In his radical quest for God, Ignatius discovers in his mystical experience at the Cardoner river in Spain that God speaks to him not only in Scripture or Tradition, but is truly present in everything. Ignatius systematizes his spiritual experiences in his ""Spiritual Exercises"" into a path for all seekers of God. To this day, the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises are not only the spiritual foundation of Jesuits worldwide, but have shaped the relationship with God of thousands of people. Can you really find God in everything? How do I find God's will for me? The film ""Ignatius - the God Seeker"" takes up the essential insights and processes of the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises and translates them into a vivid visual language. God is not to be found by withdrawing from the world, but in its discovery, appreciation, indeed in its loving embrace. This has been the message of the Jesuits through the centuries, a message that can change the Catholic Church to this day, so that it becomes more mystical, more open, more embracing, and above all, more loving. There is a theoretical background in psychology that is at work in this film. It is the thesis that our subconscious mind is not good at understanding propositional language. It does, however, understand symbols and pictures. It is implicitly claimed that Ignatius in his exercises discovered this psychological fact long before Carl G. Jung discovered the collective archetypal unconscious, or more modern approaches discovered the holistic, non-linguistic subconscious information processing in the right hemisphere. So the pictures in the film are meant to speak to the unconscious mind. They are based on pictures by great painters (like Titian and El Greco) that Ignatius might have known. The audience should not try to intellectually grasp the meaning of those images, rather let them sink into the subconscious mind which is so important for religious knowledge. The rational mind will get nourished by the expert interviews that are also part of the film."

During his childhood, Biel is barely aware of what is happening. He is a gifted child who learns to read and write at home. However, the radicalization of the political and social clashes taking place around him turns Biel into a witness of horror. The story of a teenage boy through the most violent years in the history of Spain, years that will lead to the disenchantment with which Gabriel Ferrater and other members of his generation perceive the human condition."

A highly original cross-disciplinary artist, Schloss was known for her boundary-pushing, idiosyncratic performance art, video, and installations. Through exclusive never-before-seen archival footage shot by Schloss herself and mixed with commentary from people from the scene, we trace Schloss's story and see, from her point of view, the texture of New York City's downtown art scene from the 1970s through the 1990s. Known as an ""artist's artist,"" Schloss became influential through A's, her loft space that was a hub for genre-defying music, gallery shows, performance art, films, and other happenings. A hotbed of experimentation, A's featured the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Eric Bogosian, Glenn Branca, Kim Gordon, Shirin Neshat, Thurston Moore, Alan Suiclde, Ai Wei Wei, and John Zorn, among others. In addition to the shows she curated at A's and elsewhere, Schloss gained notice as a critically acclaimed performance artist in the 1970s. A New York Times critic once described her multimedia productions as ""much superior to most performance art."" Her shows, along with A's, established Schloss as a prolific connector who brought people together from both the underground and more mainstream creative communities. In the 1980s and 1990s, Schloss became one of the first artists to integrate technology and lasers into her performance art. Schloss was frequently one of the first in a group of artists to integrate new technologies, including digital video into her projects. She evolved into a successful video artist and made inroads into other forms of digital media during the dotcom boom of the 1990s and early aughts. Continually challenging herself to create no matter the prevailing conditions, Schloss remains a transformative figure and an inspiring force in the lives of many artists and creatives. She mentored and supported up-and-coming artists from all over the world through the 2010s."

Japans tätowierte Helden,"If Japan is renowned for its rituals and refinement, one of its arts has seen its reputation tainted by scandal and has gradually sunk into oblivion: horimono tattooing. For a long time, these ink drawings were reputed to provide wearers with magical protection. They eased the fears of fishermen heading out to sea, gave heart to firefighters battling flames and strength to workers perched on the highest scaffolding. Outlawed in the mid-19th century, the horimono was then taken over by the yakuza mafia gangs, becoming a symbol of terror. Today, a handful of enthusiasts have set about restoring this tradition to its former glory. Masters of this art, born in the 17th century, open the doors of their workshops."

Are we witnesses of a chase or an escape? What role does the fear of stopping, of the end of existence, play here?

King Cake: The New Orleans Mardi Gras Story,"Journey back in time and witness the rise of ""America's Most Interesting City"". On May 7, 1718, French explorer Bienville founded La Nouvelle-Orleans (New Orleans) in honor of the Duke of Orleans. Napoleon sold Louisiana to America via the Louisiana Purchase (1803).

New Orleans has known both, the Vieux Carre fire (1788), the Battle of New Orleans (1815), hurricane Katrina (2005). From this pain comes inspiration. The invention of Jazz in New Orleans is a reflection of the city's hardships. Fat Tuesday, a springtime celebration of life, the Romans knew as Saturnalia and the Greeks knew as Kronia. Humanities' need to celebrate life has brought millions to New Orleans to enjoy ""the greatest free show on Earth""! New Orleans turns three hundred in 2018. Her tradition of creativity and love bind ""The Crescent City"" in a way one can only understand if you visit. To all whom have considered visiting ""The Big Easy"", from the French Quarter to Treme, from Algiers Point to the Garden District, Laissez les bons temps rouler (Let the good times roll)!

Kunst ja külm sõda,"A story about the relationship between independent Soviet art and the West. It recalls a time when art was larger and more important than life itself. But also a time, the like of which Estonian art has never seen and most likely will never see again. On one side, there are independent Soviet artists who lack not only the output but also the finances to complete their works. On the other side, there is the tempting West whose ambassadors (in the literal sense) take active interest in the Soviet underground art market. Selling one's works to the West is a tricky business since the almighty KGB stands between the two mutually interested parties. Nevertheless, an incredible quantity of mainly Estonian and Moscowian visual art is sold and taken across the border. This is facilitated mainly by Western diplomats, behind whose coordinated actions stands none other than the CIA."

In cheap bags, they stuff works by Lucian Freud, Paul Gauguin, Meijer de Haan, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet. It is one of the most bizarre art heists ever, not only because of the apparent ease with which the young men manage to steal the masterpieces from the museum, but more so because of the dramatic turn of events when the boys are unable to sell the paintings. Based on transcripts of police interrogations, the hybrid film THE ART OF STEALING reconstructs this high-profile theft in all its thrilling detail, the search for the stolen works, and the doubt as to whether they still exist. What is their real value, and what does it mean that these artworks have been lost?"

Kyiv Theater: An Island of Hope,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 brings back dark memories of 1930s Europe for Ariane Mnouchkine, the 84-year-old theater director and founder of the prestigious Théâtre du Soleil in Paris. Against this backdrop and in solidarity with Ukrainian resistance, Mnouchkine decides to put together a theater workshop in Kyiv, Ukraine. Twelve days of intensive training bring together hundreds of Ukranian actors - amateurs, students, and professionals from all over the country - to try their hand at Mnouchkine's unique form of improvisational theater. With little more than a rehearsal room, yellow curtain, and a few costumes, the actors will create their own island of artistic expression. But what use is art in times of war? This question looms over the documentary as it weaves together scenes from rehearsals and conversations with Ukranians about the reality of Russia's invasion. We hear from an actress whose husband has been sent to fight on the front lines and see daily alerts for Russian drones encircling Ukraine airspace. In one particularly harrowing scene, we accompany some of the actors as they traverse through city ruins to visit a memorial to victims of the Bucha massacre. Amidst the shadow of violence and loss, the theater troupe becomes a rare site of freedom and creative experimentation, allowing the actors to express feelings of tenderness, anger, joy, and love. Resisting both defeatism and naïve optimism, KYIV THEATER: AN ISLAND OF HOPE is an essential and timely exploration of what it means to create art in times of war."

L'évangile de la révolution,"Nuns murdered and buried in a mass grave. Catechism instructors shot in their own homes. An archbishop murdered in his cathedral while performing mass. For decades, Liberation Theology, a grassroots branch of Catholicism that stood with the poor and oppressed, played a powerful and influential role in Latin American revolutionary movements. Its fundamental tenet, Nicaraguan theologian and journalist María López Vigil says, is that God is not neutral, and is on the side of the poor. And because of that, its practitioners were targets. To the US, Liberation Theology was more dangerous than communism. To an increasingly conservative Vatican, it was a movement to be suppressed. Now, decades after the period of revolutionary ferment in Latin America, THE GOSPEL OF REVOLUTION travels through the region, meeting key figures and tracing the history of the Liberation Theology movement. Through powerful archival footage and contemporary interviews, the film shows how these radical Catholics fought injustice alongside peasants, workers, and Indigenous people, refusing to accept poverty and oppression. Liberation Theology stressed structural change and mutual aid, in contrast with today's more self-focused evangelical movements. At a time when evangelical Christianity is on the rise and associated with conservative politics, THE GOSPEL OF REVOLUTION serves as a powerful reminder that it doesn't have to be this way."

La machine à écrire et autres sources de tracas,"The final installment of the triptych initiated by Nicolas Philibert with On the Adamant (Golden Bear at the 2023 Berlin Film Festival) and followed by At Averroes and Rosa Parks - and likely the most intimate and moving of the three - continues its deep dive into the psychiatric center of Paris. This time, the filmmaker follows resourceful caregivers as they assist patients suddenly faced with a domestic issue - a broken appliance. Behind the camera, while remaining very present, Philibert allows events to unfold naturally, as he skillfully does. Through all these objects that are repaired, it is ultimately the people and their souls that are healed. The volunteers pay attention with respect, patience, and genuine interest in everyone's stories, needs, and worries. And they are filmed with similar care and attention. The film offers time and space for meandering conversations, internal monologues spoken out loud, unexpected guests, musical interludes, and long silences. A warm portrait and plea for compassion."

Le cinquième plan de La Jetée,"In the Chris Marker exhibition at the Cinémathèque Française, my cousin Jean-Henri recognized himself in La Jetée. Seen from behind, the photo of him and his parents on the observation deck of Orly Airport is the fifth shot of the film. If it's him, he was the hero of the film as a child. Our whole family recognized them, and I was drawn to his vision and the secret paths it opened up into our family history and the story of these images. It was at Orly Airport that we arrived from Algeria in 1962. As for Marker... Because images imprint themselves on our consciousness, films can and do belong to us. And few films have been more dear to history than Chris Marker's La Jetée (1962), a minimalist masterpiece often ranked among the greatest and most influential. But as acclaimed director Dominique Cabrera belatedly discovers in her latest feature, Marker's science-fiction photo-montage might also be an unwitting historical document about her own family. La Jetée was made the very year Algerian independence was declared, and at a time when hundreds of thousands of French people of Algerian descent, like Cabrera's family, were retreating to Paris via Orly Airport. Sixty years later, the director's cousin is convinced that it is he who appears in the fifth frame of the film, standing next to his parents as they greet their loved ones at the airport. A detective novel ensues, revealing evidence about their family, French colonialism, Marker, and the film itself.

Limelight,"LIMELIGHT is a feature documentary directed by Eddie Beyrouthy (Beyond the Wasteland) that tells the story of The Salvation Army's Limelight Department, founded in Australia 1891. Specialising in what were revolutionary magic lantern shows and early film projection, music and performance, the Limelight Department became one of the world's first functioning film studios, paving the way for the birth of the Australian film industry, until it was forced to close its doors in 1910, ending a never-to-be-repeated chapter in The Salvation Army history. The documentary uncovers how Salvationist and showman, Captain Joseph Perry, with the support of Commandant Herbert Booth, augmented the army's finances and established one of the world's first film studios, and how a handful of Salvation Army officers, working out of a small attic space in The Salvation Army's building on Bourke Street, ended up producing over 400 films, including the Inauguration of the Commonwealth, the Departure of Australian troops for the Boer War, and the largest production of any narrative drama in the world at the time with Soldiers of the Cross. Limelight brings to life the stories of the first Australian pioneers of the moving image and restores an iconic piece of Australian history, and a cherished part of The Salvation Army's rich history with unseen original footage and archives, transformed using today's digital production techniques, with the addition of sound design and original music. Moreover, it examines the extraordinary and innovative lengths the church aspired to in spreading the word of the gospel on a global scale. Few people know that Melbourne had one of the world's earliest film studios and if it hadn't been forced to close in 1910 the history of Australian, and even world cinema might have been very different."

Lise,"During the reign of Sultan II. Abdülhamid, an education reform spread the Istanbul-based education system to Rumelia, Anatolia, and the Middle East. The aim was to improve the education of Muslim children and to train loyal civil servants for the Ottoman State. Many schools were opened in this period, including Kayseri Idadi. Established in 1893, Kayseri Idadi witnessed the troubles of the late Ottoman period, the Balkan Wars, and World War I. It was converted to a Sultani during World War I. Due to its proximity to Ankara, it closely followed the Turkish War of Independence. After the losses in the Eskisehir-Kütahya battles, there were discussions about moving the parliament to Kayseri and using the Kayseri Sultani building. While the Turkish army, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was preparing for the Battle of Sakarya, Kayseri Sultani students also wanted to participate in this struggle. The story of these high school students who fought in the Sakarya War is an unforgettable example. After the foundation of the Republic, Kayseri Sultani and similar institutions played a significant role in educating the future generations of the new country. Kayseri Sultani, which was also visited by Atatürk, was renamed Kayseri Lisesi with the Republic. Having a considerable impact on Turkey's social, political, and daily life, Kayseri has raised two presidents, numerous artists, business people, and valuable teachers. Kayseri Lisesi, with its architecture, is also one of the important places of Turkey's recent history and is one of the symbols of the city. It is often referred to as simply ""Lise"" by the people of Kayseri."

Openly alluding to Virginia Woolf's famous quote (""A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction"") and introducing us to a bouquet of incredible, uncompromised female characters, an investigative yet tender camera challenges the boundaries of gendered social roles and immerses in the micro-universe of absolute freedom and self-determination."

"Lulu and the Girls of Americus, Georgia 1963","This is an investigative documentary that took many years to produce and for the first time shed light on an unknown tragic story about the abuse of black children during the Civil Rights Movement. You might have heard of ""The Stockade Girls"" in Essence magazine or ""The Stolen Girls of Leesburg"" on NPR, or even a Washington Post article on the Leesburg Stockade Girls. This is the original documentary film that started it all. Our intense research accurately details how young people in the small rural town of Americus, Georgia got involved in a civil rights demonstration against a local segregated movie theater. Once arrested, thirty-two girls were isolated and imprisoned in a deserted Civil War-era prison for forty-five days. All told from the perspective of Lulu Westbrooks-Griffin along with her brother James Westbrooks and their niece Gloria Breedlove. We tracked down as many of the surviving women who opened up for the first time about what happened that painful summer of 1963 and how their lives changed. We tried to get local people in Americus to talk about the incident but never got any responses. We have exclusive interviews with two key Civil Rights icons, Congressman John Lewis and Julian Bond, who not only remember the incident but reflected passionately and put into historical perspective the plight of the young girls and their place in history. Lulu and the Girls of Americus, Georgia 1963 has been screened at the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY, the Angelica Theater in New York City, the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta, The Great Wax and Blacks Museum in Baltimore, and at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, which was hosted by Congressman John Lewis. This film has been honored by several film festivals and awards, including the Hollywood International Diversity Film Festival and the Toronto Film Magazine Festival, and has been awarded a Gold Telly Award and is an Accolade Global Film Competition Winner. The documentary chronicles one of the darkest moments of the Civil Rights Movement in American history. In one of the last conversations with the late Congressman John Lewis and Julian Bond, they encouraged us to complete the film and make every effort to get it on national television. We are now fulfilling that promise."

Mangyan Ambahan: Wisdom for Our Filipino Soul,"""Mangyan Ambahan: Wisdom for Our Filipino Soul"" is a powerful documentary by Chiara Cox created in collaboration with the Mangyan Heritage Center. This film is a deep dive into one of the few surviving ancient Filipino writing systems-the Hanunuo Mangyan script, which is based on the Indic script. As one of only four pre-10th-century indigenous scripts still in use today, it remains an essential part of Mangyan culture through the 'ambahan.' Ambahan or 'sung poetry' shares wisdom across generations and gives us a glimpse into the pre-colonial Filipino: their beliefs, worldview, values, and philosophies. This indigenous literary form is unique in that each line has seven syllables that end in rhyme. Each poem has been written and rewritten on bamboo for centuries and chanted at festivities in order to keep the wisdom of their ancestors alive. There have been over 20,000 ambahan recorded by Antoon Postma, a Dutch missionary and anthropologist best known for deciphering the famed Laguna Copperplate (which proves that pre-colonial Filipinos were literate) and for preserving the Hanunuo Mangyan script. Chiara's documentary brings the ambahan tradition and the Mangyan culture to life through interviews, stories, and archival photographs from the Mangyan Heritage Center. The film discusses the self-preservation and resilience of a people with a peace loving nature. It also examines the fast pace effects of modernity on a culture that may be endangered and the present function of the Mangyan Heritage Center. Furthermore, through a personal lens, Chiara reveals the Mangyan tribe's enduring impact not only on Filipino heritage, but also on the global diaspora."

Marcos - Willpower,"Can beauty save the world? Can art save us from reality? Documentary about Brazilian artist Marcos Santos de São José dos Campos. Marcos was born with cerebral palsy and therefore cannot use his hands. He does everything with his feet... The camera follows Marcos' life from 1996 to today. A time-lapse documentary about talent, perseverance and infinite willpower. At birth, Marcos Santos suffered from oxygen deprivation in his brain. As a result, he became permanently physically disabled, causing paralysis in his hands and arms, while his speech became partially impaired. In his childhood, Marcos learned to communicate through art. His first drawings were made with a piece of charcoal he found in the street. The film portrays the work and life of this amazing individual. Director Statement: I started working on the Marcos Willpowert film in 1996, shooting with an ARRI 16mm film camera, a Kodak negative. I finished the film with DSLR Canon 5D. This film is not only a time-lapse of the life of an extraordinary artist, but also a time-lapse of the changes in the film technique I used. Regardless of the different cameras, the cinematic expression always remains unchanged. The camera is just a tool with which we tell our dreams. One of the ideas of the project... The colour of one's skin, the background, the shape of one's body, the address.....none of this matters if one has strong will to change the situation one is in. Marcos' strong will and zest for life secure him place in the society on par with able bodied people. His remarkable personality should be motivator for everyone - being it disabled or able bodied person. It is important to add that the Government of Brazil is not helping Marcos in any way, yet he is capable of not only supporting himself, but also his large family. Unlimited potential of a human being and the ability to adapt to any situation is the main message of this film and Marcos is an extraordinary example of this potential. His story certainly deserves to be transferred to tape and shown on film festivals, TV as well as workshops for people feeling down and out."

Marvin Johnson,"The documentary Marvin Johnson: The Life of a Champion dives deep into the inspiring story of Marvin Johnson, an Indianapolis-born boxer who brought the city's boxing scene back to life. In an era where Indiana was known more for basketball than boxing, Johnson emerged as a beacon of hope, becoming a three-time world champion and Olympic bronze medalist. Johnson's journey began at the age of 14, when he first walked into the St. Rita Police Athletic League gym, where former fighter Champ Chaney took him under his wing. Displaying a relentless fighting style that one reporter described as ""a thrashing octopus,"" Johnson quickly rose through the amateur ranks, becoming a Golden Gloves champion and, eventually, an Olympian. Turning professional after the Olympics, Johnson's career was filled with ups and downs, from challenging fights against formidable opponents like Matthew Saad Muhammad and Victor Galindez to financial struggles and frequent managerial changes. Despite these hurdles, he captured the light heavyweight title not once but three times, representing a rebirth of Indianapolis as a boxing city. Known for his tenacity, Johnson endured a grueling series of matches, including his fierce rivalry with Leslie Stewart. In their rematch, Johnson gave his all but finally surrendered to age in the ninth round, marking the end of his storied career. He retired to serve as a corrections officer in Marion County, where he made headlines for using his life experience to help inmates. Later, he satisfied his competitive spirit with bowling, all while looking back on a career with no regrets."
Mary Pickford's Kiss,"In July 1926, at the height of their fame, Hollywood stars Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks made a historic visit to the Soviet Union. Their arrival coincided with the death of the founder of the Cheka, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and, ironically, their hotel was located next to the Hall of Columns, where his body lay in state. The atmosphere took on a nearly surreal quality, as crowds alternated between mourning the Soviet leader and joyfully welcoming the Hollywood stars. Despite the brevity of their stay, Pickford and Fairbanks left an indelible mark on the hearts of Soviet admirers-poets wrote verses, and musicians composed songs in their honor. Director Sergei Komarov even managed to film the comedy Mary Pickford's Kiss, starring Igor Ilyinsky and Anel Sudakevich in the lead roles. However, just a few years later, the silent film era would come to an end, and the world-renowned Pickford would find herself an unneeded actress. This story serves as a reflection on life, talent, fame, time, and fate."

Metamorphosis,"Portugal, 1938. Under the weight of the Estado Novo regime, the afforestation law transforms entire villages: communal lands are expropriated, subsistence farming withers, and the silence of the mountains echoes with contained revolt. António Claro leaves his homeland and finds refuge in the highest settlement of the Serra of Lousã, where he builds a family and a future in a place fertile, abundant in water and life. Yet prosperity conceals an underground tension: as the winds of modernity blow, neighboring villages are deserted, and his children too, depart in search of a future in the cities. Only the youngest remains, caught between the heritage of the land and the promises of progress. In him lies the fate of these lands, suspended between roots and rupture. METAMORPHOSIS promotes a reflection on Social Metamorphosis, associated with the ""detraditionalization of forms of life"", a process of liberation from past social forms that paves the way for the formation of new identities and social practices. But it is also an objection to the growing dissatisfaction with the present, to the view that the past is an utopia and the future a very uncertain destiny, which ignores the fact that aging is a natural, dynamic, progressive and irreversible process that has been with us since birth, until death. Committed to the reality of the past, the film shows how social mutations arise from the great contemporary forces created by man himself and the need to adapt to their achievements. But it also shows how the search for forms of life that value memory, without being tied to history, without fearing contradictions or the unknown, allows us to overcome the discourses of fatality that sentence the future."

Monica moves into a new apartment building. The building is almost empty. Only one unit, directly above her, is occupied by Mariusz. A mysterious jazz musician, a bon vivant, a colorful bird. And for Monica: an unreformed troublemaker, jam sessions until dawn or punk/reggae/ska parties with the elite of the Zoliborz underground mean sleepless nights in the apartment for which, after all, she pays the mortgage every month. Mariusz doesn't respond to pleas for calm: ""How can you prohibit music? Monica writes petitions and complaints, calls the police every day, and signs protocols incriminating her neighbor. But Mariusz and Monika meet - over the grave of a mutual friend. The famous ""wasted"" literary genius Konrad died unexpectedly at the age of 42.

The stations of Bambic's biographical circle - Trieste, Idrija, Trieste, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Trieste - the film presents through pictorial material, drawings, pictures, archival footage, comics, which shed light on a versatile artistic career, important for the culture of Slovenia , both in the period between the wars and today. The 20th century on the Central European-Balkan soil with all its dramatic shifts, from Austria-Hungary through SHS, the first and second Yugoslavia to the eve of the independence of the members of the then federation, marked the artist's stay. Among other things, Milko Bambic created art equipment for Radenska mineral water from 1931, with a characteristic inscription that is still in use today, and with the well-known three red hearts patriotically indicated the ""brotherhood of the SHS"" at that time. He began his work during the rise of nationalism and fascism, he could not resist political activism. In 1927, in the monthly magazine Nas glas, he published the anti-fascist satirical comic book Bu-ci-bu about a small, arrogant and tyrannical black king, a parable of Benito Mussolini: in this work, the first Slovenian comic, he predicted his downfall."

Despite her South American marketing degree, she struggles to survive in the low-wage sector. Her two children have long been living with her Swiss ex-husband, and she sees them only sporadically. When Naima loses her job again, she decides to fight for training at the employment office - she wants to finally gain a foothold in society. With the support of her circle of friends and government agencies, Naima is able to secure an apprenticeship to become a nurse. At the same time, her 17-year-old son Luke announces his intention to move into her small apartment. He is undergoing gender reassignment and wants a change of scenery. Naima is challenged and highly motivated to face these challenges. However, happiness is fragile. During her first internship, she is confronted with the harsh realities of nursing. Patients appreciate her warmth, humour and meaningful conversations, but professionally she is criticised for being too emotionally involved. At home, her son often reacts with incomprehension to her mentality, and she increasingly feels relegated into the role of an outsider. The pressure in the internship grows, and when she learns that she has failed the internship, Naima's world collapses. Her last chance to establish herself seems to be slipping away, and she threatens to fall back into the same depression she experienced when her marriage broke up and she was left alone with her children in a foreign country. But this time, Naima seeks help - both her boyfriend and a union lawyer encourage her to appeal, and Naima begins her toughest fight ever: to stand up for herself. Naima wins the appeal and is granted a pass retroactively. However, the wound of experienced discrimination remains. Entering the next internship with great uncertainty and trying not to stand out, this time she is valued by the team and passes her internship. At the grand diploma ceremony of her class, friends, family, and companions gather. Naima dazzles in a sexy South American-style orange cocktail dress and basks in the glow. After the party, Luke shyly pulls her aside and performs a self-composed rap, expressing his admiration and love for his mother."

This documentary examines the DNA of Nesher's cinematic creations , which include musicals, dramas, and comedies, chronicling the homeland in which he started his career at the age of 24 and where he continues to create at 71."
Neshoma,"Neshoma is set in Amsterdam between World War I & II, when one out of ten of the city's residents was Jewish. Seventeen-year-old Rusha lives in the Jewish quarter with her family. Her older brother Max has emigrated to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. In her letters to Max, Rusha recounts daily life in the city. This creates a vivid image of Amsterdam during the interwar period, from the perspective of the Jewish community. The film begins shortly after World War I, a period full of confidence in the future. The combination of Rusha's letters and archival footage creates a colorful portrait of proud diamond cutters; haggling traders at the flea market; cabaret artists with songs that everyone sings along to; city officials like De Miranda, who are committed to social housing; and the entrepreneurs behind warehouse De Bijenkorf, the luxurious Amstel Hotel, and cinema Tuschinski. These stories illustrate the importance of the Jewish community to the city. The initial optimism after World War I is gradually tested by a severe economic depression and the rise of fascism, leading to the occupation of The Netherlands. Humor and zest for life, the ""lechajim,"" provide comfort to the Jews in times of adversity. Against this backdrop, Rusha grows from a young girl into an independent woman, lovingly navigating between the ideas of her socialist father and the religious beliefs of her husband. The outbreak of World War II presents her with an impossible choice. Neshoma is not only about the lives of those who are no longer here, but also about what they have left behind: the Jewish soul of Amsterdam, the neshoma."

This was especially true of atrocities that were used repeatedly by politicians in Israel and the West to justify the ferocity of the bombardment of the Gaza Strip, such as the mass killing of babies and allegations of widespread and systematic rape."

On Moral Grounds,"Shot on location in Eastern Europe and in the courtrooms of the United States, this documentary brings to light the saga of WWII restitution and the stories of those who have sought justice for half a century. One man, Adolf Stern, takes us on an emotional journey that mirrors similar quests by thousands of other Holocaust survivors. After being liberated from Buchenwald, Adolf, penniless, traveled to Prague to redeem his father's life insurance. Rather than being consoled as a survivor of unspeakable horrors, he was thrown out of the insurance company office. He was told: ""No death certificate, no insurance claim."" Not until 1996 did the matter arise again. Adolf's niece, attorney Lisa Stern, heard the story through family members. Lisa teamed up with the pioneer of bad faith insurance law, William Shernoff, and set off on an incomparable legal odyssey. Against all odds, the two lawyers were determined to right the wrong perpetrated on Adolf and other survivors by insurance companies, which were supposed to take care of their policyholders in times of need. This David and Goliath account explores how persistence and powerful advocacy can achieve justice for wrongs committed half a century ago in a foreign land."

She managed to contact Ken Pontac, long-time Facebook friend and father figure. Their conversations bolstered Milena's spirits while Ken listened with growing apprehension. With food running low, Milena was ""liberated"" by Russians and taken at gunpoint to a Russian-controlled refugee camp in the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. While imprisoned she slept on a filthy, freezing floor with her mother, grandmother, and 200 other kidnapped Ukrainians. After being rescued by a sympathetic Russian, Milena and family were released to a small apartment nearby. But she was still a prisoner. With Ken's help and the heroic efforts of the international team he assembled three generations of the family were extricated from their imprisonment, furtively couch surfing through Russian safe-houses until finally reaching what they believed was freedom in Estonia. A red-tape nightmare forced the family to return to their war-torn home, where they await the international documents that will help them find a life on the other side of the world...if only they're not recaptured by Russian troops again. This is not a story about war. This is a story about three generations of women (and a cat) caught in the middle. It's about finding their way to freedom with the help of a group they've never met and the virtual father who just wants his daughter to be safe."

Personale,"The washing machines are spinning, people are cleaning, folding towels, vacuuming and mopping floors. Contrary to our own experiences as guests in a hotel, we take a look behind the scenes and see what they are trying hard to hide: we observe the housekeeping team at their tiring daily work in a 4-star hotel in the Italian Dolomites. The women and few men on the staff, all with a history of migration, wear white aprons and blue gloves and ensure constant cleanliness. We follow their routine movements in the corridors, hotel rooms and the hotel laundry room. A completely new perspective opens up, determined by the cyclical repetition of the same activities: folding towels, making beds and mopping floors and bathrooms. The overriding maxim is to keep the tourist machinery running despite all internal and external resistance. There is talk of shifts that are far too long, hardly any sleep and no opportunities for vacation or sick leave. What the workers share are the brief breaks at the coffee machine or stories from their personal lives that intertwine with their daily routines. Moments of connection emerge, illuminating the hectic nature of their everyday lives. ""Personale"" radically and exclusively takes the perspective of the workers. Of the hotel guests, who usually only stay temporarily, we only discover traces, as the cleaning staff regularly finds them: dirty dishes, empty coffee cups, forgotten earrings or scraps of paper. The film takes a close look at this seemingly immaculate microcosm, tells us about the living realities of the workers, and makes visible what is meant to remain invisible."

As he contemplates whether he is the Strandbeests' master or slave, Theo races against the inevitable passing of time and his eventual death.

Plainspoken,"Over the four decades since Jimmy Carter left the White House to return to his hometown of Plains, Georgia-the unassuming farming town of 700 people nestled inside the quiet spaciousness of Southwest Georgia-millions of people from around the world of every race, culture and creed have made the pilgrimage to Plains for an extraordinary glimpse into the simple life of America's longest-living President and former First Lady. Anchored in America's storied deep south, Plains perimeters major civil rights conflicts of the 1950's and 60's, where long-upheld segregationist platforms isolated and abused integrationist stands. Just a few decades ago, the town occupied national headlines as Plains Baptist Church refused to allow Black people membership on the grounds that they would not be admitted into Heaven. Even President Carter's own parents, Earl Carter, Sr. and Lillian Carter, held starkly opposing views on race relations while raising the future leader of the free world, a position Carter secured in part because of his progressive stance on a racially integrated New South. So how does a township built of hard-working people who prize morality and family values still suffer the segregated divisions of race and contentions of equality even while under the influence of the Carters' lifelong pledge to pursue peace, promote human rights, and perpetuate ""liberty and justice for all?"" This is the dilemma of the place, the people, and the president from Plains. This is ... Plainspoken."

Pour faire un monde,N/A
Pour faire un monde,"Bienvenue à Marchésieux, Marchuus pour les intimes. C'est même officiel, cette double identité. Depuis peu. Comme en témoignent les panneaux d'entrées sur les RD 94 et 433. Petite commune de Normandie. Un peu plus de 700 habitants. Elle n'est pas sur les chemins de Compostelle. Quoique... le Mont-Saint-Michel n'est pas si loin. Disons qu'elle est sur les chemins de traverse, on y passe peu, on y vient, si l'on a à y faire... Bref, Marchésieux, trou normand ? C'est tout le contraire... disons plutôt centre d'intérêt majeur pour nos campagnes en mutation. Ici, depuis 40 ans (déjà !), on lutte pour une transition environnementale harmonieuse. À Marchuus, une ferme sur deux a choisi de passer au bio, des urbains en mal d'air pur postulent à une installation durable, le parc naturel régional du Cotentin (qui n'existerait peut-être pas sans Marchuus et quelques Marchuais) fait rimer vertus et contraintes, la commune cernée de marais se mobilise pour ne pas retourner au «désert» (médical, social, culturel...). On pratique la démocratie participative. On s'efforce d'y cultiver un bien précieux : les liens. Méfions-nous toutefois d'un tableau trop idyllique. Rien n'est jamais acquis. La commune sait ce qu'elle doit à l'un de ses anciens élus. Or Léon Ourry qui fut le maître d'oeuvre de ces mutations et « faits de résistance » est mort depuis peu. Tout l'enjeu pour l'actuelle équipe municipale, renouvelée lors des dernières élections, est de poursuivre sur la lancée et d'imaginer une suite. C'est une ambition qui semble bien aller à Anne Hébert, la nouvelle maire, femme énergique et résolue. Parviendra-t-elle à maintenir voire réinventer le «modèle» fragile de Marchésieux ? A continuer de concilier nouvelles et anciennes pratiques agricoles ? A préserver les digues de son identité face aux vagues ininterrompues des réformes territoriales ? A attirer, accueillir et intégrer de nouveaux arrivants ? Ou à contrario, à lutter contre l'exode ? C'est tout l'enjeu de ce film. Il raconte Marchuus face à elle-même et à notre avenir en commun. Pendant plus d'un an, le réalisateur, très sensiblement du cru, Rémi Mauger, a promené sa caméra à la croisée de tous ces questionnements et débats. Une chronique qui conjugue passé, présent et avenir, en suivant les habitants au plus près et par tous les temps. Qu'on ne s'y trompe pas : à l'échelle microcosmique de Marchésieux se vivent tous les enjeux de la ruralité contemporaine. Ou quand la fameuse transition est un défi quotidien... et plus seulement un slogan de campagne."

Ruigoord - Een Kosmisch Lek,"Ruigoord, the village on the outskirts of Amsterdam that was once squatted by hippies, is the oldest cultural free space in the Netherlands. It has continually reinvented itself and managed to save itself twice from Amsterdam's expansion plans. In 2023, Ruigoord celebrates its 50th anniversary, but what should be a festive highlight could also become its swan song. The port of Amsterdam plans to use the surrounding oil tanks for storing green hydrogen to facilitate Amsterdam's energy transition. Hydrogen is quite explosive, putting the entire village in a danger zone. Will the cosmic gateway - to which the Ruigoorders attribute the magic surrounding the village - provide relief? How does the community deal with this contradiction, having fought for free space since the 1970s? These complex issues arise as they approach the celebration of their 50th anniversary."

For 25 years he ran longer and farther than virtually anyone else, competing in over 300 marathons and ultra marathons, winning on all seven continents and rising with the long-distance movement. Once he exhausted everyone else's, he made his own challenges. He crossed counties, states and other countries while setting Guinness World Records along the way. Ready to finally achieve his lifelong dream, Michael discovers there's nothing simple about running 3,000 miles from California to Delaware. At 48 years old he still has a supernatural ability to recover but this transcontinental run is significantly farther than anything he's attempted before. After the first week and a half, it will all be new territory. Michael's longtime friend and logistics planner, Phil Hargis, maps out a meticulous route across the middle of the country along Old Route 50. To help support him along the way he enlists his father, who is in his seventies but still well up for the adventure and hires Eric Belz who helped Karl Meltzer set the Appalachian Trail record in 2016. The three of them rent an RV that will be their home for journey. At a pace of two marathons a day Michael is hoping to finish in two months, starting at San Francisco City Hall on May 1st and reaching Rehoboth Beach on the Fourth of July. But even the best laid plans come undone when they hit the road. To realize his dream, he'll have to use everything he's learned until now to meet unexpected challenges within himself and his two-man crew.

Russi d'Africa,"On August 23rd, 2023, the leader of the Russian Wagner paramilitary group Evgenij Prigozin died in mysterious circumstances in a plane crash. Despite this, a few months after his death, members of the world's most renowned mercenary group continue their operations in several African conflicts, spanning from Mali to the Central African Republic, from Libya to Sudan. Wagner has been in the Central African Republic since 2018 to protect the besieged president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra. While most of the population welcomes this presence, a report from an independent investigative body denounces the violence and brutality of the Wagner group mercenaries, accused of summary executions, robberies, looting, and violence against women. Yet the responsibility of these crimes against humanity has not been clearly established. With the prestigious contribution of former Wagner commander Marat Gabidullin, that of French political analyst Emmanuel Dupuy and CAR president's counselor, the documentary explores the puzzled reality in Central African Republic, a paradigm for Russian expansion into Africa, which once again has become a land of conquest. Unlike in the past, however, the gradual Russian expansion on the continent is influencing global geopolitical relations. Africa, with all its contradictions, is a candidate to become the crucial continent for the future of international economic and political balances."

The story begins with Putin's early years, from his modest childhood in post-war Leningrad to his ascent through the ranks of the KGB and his ultimate rise to power. It examines the events and influences that shaped his leadership style, as well as his vision for Russia's role on the world stage. At the same time, the film delves into Korea's rich and tumultuous history, from ancient dynasties and the scars of Japanese occupation to the division of the peninsula and the creation of North Korea under Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. With this historical foundation, the focus turns to the present, exploring the intricate and sometimes surprising relationship between Putin and Kim. Despite their countries' differences in size, ideology, and history, these leaders have found common ground in shared ambitions and defiance of Western dominance. Through economic ties, military cooperation, and diplomatic gestures, their partnership has grown stronger amidst increasing global scrutiny. Looking ahead, the film asks critical questions about the future. As both leaders face mounting challenges-economic sanctions, political instability, and shifting global dynamics-how will their alliance evolve? Will their partnership strengthen, or will external pressures drive them apart? This riveting exploration provides a nuanced look at the intersection of history, power, and the geopolitical forces shaping tomorrow."

One of the greatest puzzles is how the ancestors of all vertebrates-the first ""fish""-evolved. In December 1998, Professor Shu Degan from Northwestern University (now an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) identified the fossil of Haikouichthys from the Cambrian strata in Chengjiang. This fossil is believed to be the earliest known ancestor of vertebrates, earning the title ""the first fish"" and becoming a sensational discovery worldwide. It also marks a significant contribution by Chinese scientists to global paleontology. For over 100 years, the mystery of the Cambrian Explosion has been a central focus of paleontological research. Yunnan's Chengjiang fossil site is the largest Cambrian fossil treasure trove in the world, and thanks to the relentless efforts of Chinese paleontologists, many of the mysteries left by the Cambrian period have been unraveled. However, countless enigmas still await future scientists to solve. Geomagnetic Reversal: In 1906, French geophysicist Bernard Brunhes first discovered that Earth's magnetic field may have reversed in the past. In 2017, a research team consisting of scientists from mainland China, Taiwan, and Australia collected rare high-resolution samples from the Sanxing Cave in Guizhou, China. Using precise measurement and dating techniques, they studied paleomagnetic information recorded in the cave's stalagmites and found evidence of the fastest geomagnetic reversal ever recorded, which occurred over just 144 years. This discovery stunned the world, revealing a reversal speed 10 times faster than previously known. Scientists have also found that Earth's magnetic field strength is declining at an accelerated rate, with the current rate being 10 times faster than earlier estimates. From 1970 to 2020, the magnetic field weakened by approximately 8%. Since 1840, when records began, the magnetic north pole has been shifting toward the geographic north pole, with its displacement over the past 20 years exceeding the total movement of the previous 100 years. All of these signs suggest that we may be on the verge of another geomagnetic reversal. How do geomagnetic reversals occur, and what impact do they have on life on Earth? This film was shot on location in Heilongjiang, Yunnan, and Guizhou, China, and features footage from the Zero-Magnetic Laboratory at the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Earth Science Laboratory at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory. Interviews with leading scientists will provide an in-depth exploration and explanation of this natural mystery."
Seek out Natural Mysteries: The Unseen Force at Work,"The Turbulence Enigma: Turbulence is a common yet complex phenomenon in fluid motion, representing a core challenge in fluid mechanics and a longstanding scientific puzzle. The renowned physicist Richard Feynman once referred to turbulence as ""the last great unsolved problem of classical physics."" One of the Millennium Prize Problems is centered around the Navier-Stokes equations, closely tied to the behavior of turbulence, specifically whether smooth solutions to these equations exist. Turbulence has profound implications across mathematics, mechanics, and physics and has become a critical bottleneck in advancing national aerospace, aviation, and maritime engineering. It is one of the most urgent fundamental challenges China faces today. This film vividly recounts the history and current state of turbulence research, taking viewers on a journey through key national laboratories, including Zhejiang University's Fluid Mechanics Lab, Peking University's School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Tsinghua University's Turbulence and Complex Systems Lab, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Mechanics. Interviews with leading Chinese scientists will demystify fundamental concepts such as Reynolds numbers and the Navier-Stokes equations. Through immersive footage of wind tunnel experiments, the audience will gain insight into the critical role wind tunnels play in turbulence research. Visits to Tsinghua University and the Institute of Mechanics will also introduce viewers to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), sparking a passion for exploring the mysteries of turbulence, especially among younger viewers. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs): In 2007, astronomer Duncan Lorimer discovered the first-ever Fast Radio Burst (FRB) in historical archival data from Australia's Parkes Observatory. Lasting only a few milliseconds, yet with immense energy output, this discovery immediately ignited excitement in the global astronomy community. FRBs have since become one of the most significant findings in radio astronomy, comparable to the four great discoveries of the 20th century. Over the past decade, despite becoming a hot topic in astronomy, the origins of FRBs remain unresolved. We know that magnetars are one of the sources, but they are not the only ones-FRBs are likely the result of some cosmic-scale event. The study of FRBs is now one of the most active fields in astronomy, with major observatories, including China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), diligently tracking these cosmic phenomena. FRBs were recognized by Science magazine as one of the top 10 scientific breakthroughs in both 1997 and 1999. This film begins with the story of young Chinese astronomer Luo Rui, who, in September 2019, used FAST to observe FRB 180301. His observation marked a significant scientific breakthrough: it was the world's first successful prediction of a repeating FRB. Luo's research was later published in the prestigious journal Nature. The film will narrate the history of FRB discoveries and highlight the contributions of Chinese scientists, aiming to ignite enthusiasm for astronomy, particularly among younger viewers."

Seul Godard,"How do you craft the portrait of Jean-Luc Godard, or better yet a portrait of his methodology, his universe, his way of constructing or deconstructing cinema, that is equal to his own cinematic audacity and genius? How could it be anything other than by taking risks, and trying out equally radical methods, never straying from to his example. The two filmmakers immerse us into the storage warehouse where, in 2010, all the archives kept by Godard in Switzerland were transferred, and they create a doppelganger (or a duplicate) of the director, who takes up the role of our guide into his world. Excerpts from his writings, his images, his perspective in cinema give us a glimpse into his mythology, his techniques, his singular gaze, and therefore also in his worldview. His questions, his relentless experimentation in cinema, and the nature of creation are showcased here as being both truly prolific, as well as still relevant, while they are intricately intertwined into a film essay that we are certain even Godard himself would have enjoyed."

Singulares,"Diversity is the theme of the documentary Singulares, directed by Patricia Travassos and produced by Prosa Press. The film connects six personalities from Brazilian arts and sports who transform supposed vulnerabilities into power, using the body as a guiding thread. The body as knowledge, as speech, as discourse. The body full of particularities from which there is no intention of escaping, on the contrary: to occupy, resist and overflow. The political body, the playing body, the one that creates, surprises, entertains, that makes people reflect, that carries causes. The body as ancestry, a place that holds wisdom from other times, and when occupied with affection and awareness, points to a more colorful and diverse future. Singulares addresses themes such as art, politics, inclusion, ancestry, representation and visibility through multidisciplinary artists and personalities who have become a source of inspiration and reference in contemporary times. CHARACTERS: Ney Matogrosso is a Brazilian cultural icon. Artist considered one of the precursors of androgyny as an aesthetic. With a countertenor voice and a sinuous, bouncy body, he was a counterpoint to Brazil's leaden years, having gained respect in extremely conservative times and influenced generations since his performance in the group Secos & Molhados until today. Rebeca Andrade is the first Brazilian gymnast to be Olympic champion, the first Brazilian athlete to win two medals in the same edition of the Olympic Games, not to mention unprecedented achievements in world championships. Born and raised in Guarulhos, she left home at the age of 9 to train and, after successive injuries, won titles dancing the funk Baile de Favela. At the most recent world championship, in 2023, she was part of a historic artistic gymnastics podium, formed for the first time by three black women: herself and two Americans: Simone Biles and Shilese Jones. Raphael Jacques, with a degree in fine arts and social sciences, transforms himself into Alma Negrot - a drag queen created from discards, courage, boldness of materials and symbols. Each day, Alma is one, and Rapha is another. His body is an instrument of what he calls poetic terrorism. It is through him that he invents other ways of being in the world. ""I don't need to ask for respect by raising signs. My body carries a political charge."" Léo Castilho is a deaf man who uses his body as his speech. Not only where he communicates, but beyond, where he reflects on the world around him. Despite society imposing a certain type of path for people with his condition, Léo goes beyond these limits, becoming a poet, actor and a great admirer of music. 8 years ago, he decided to stop using hearing aids so that, in silence, he could hear himself better and discover his own sounds. He hears so much through touch and what he sees and what he feels, that he is able to work with music. In contact with other listening artists, he creates a third way, impossible to achieve without the diversity of experiences and perceptions of the world. Mona Rikumbi is the first black woman in a wheelchair to dance at the São Paulo Municipal Theater. Even though she discovered that she has Neuromyelitis Optica at the age of 30, Mona did not let this condition paralyze her. She is a body artist, actress, dancer and activist, and broke with the stereotypes that awaited her, even rejecting her own prognosis, which gave her little time to live. Katú Mirim makes us reflect on the body as a place of ancestral knowledge. She is an indigenous woman who returned to her origins late, having been adopted at a young age by a white family. She says that from a very young age her dreams, visions and intuitions already reflected the heritage of her people. Katú subverts current logic by using rap to leave messages for the people of the future, while at the same time honoring their past."

He was so talented and determined that, at the age of 11, he caught the eye of filmmaker Van Alpert. Over the next ten years, Van documented Leandre's struggle to perfect his skateboarding and to survive. At 14-years old, Leandre was forced to leave his rapidly unravelling family life and started sleeping rough at the bowl of the skate park, relying on his friend Haden and the kindness of a local woman, Katie, who looked out for the two boys. And despite this adversity, Leandre never lost his drive to skate - Set against the visually palpable decline of LA, the decade captured by Van charts Leandre's journey to an internationally-respected skater who has perfected his own unique 'no stance' skate style. The result is a gritty reflection of what it takes to make it in the skating world - and what it takes to survive as a disadvantaged kid in the United States. Pulsing with a tactile sense of street style and punctuated by an incredible soundtrack. Skategoat is a story about the streets told from the streets, that proves anyone can seize their dream."

Slenderverse: An Artistic Movement,"In the early 2010's, internet horror icon Slenderman became the centerpiece of a rapidly evolving artistic movement, forming what is known as 'The Slenderverse'. On the surface, the Slenderverse appeared to be a Marvel-style cinematic universe; an interconnected mythology of independent art projects. However, unbeknownst to the general public, creators congregated under the umbrella of the private 'Slenderverse Creators' community and formed an online artistic collective unlike any seen before at the time of its creation in 2011. ""Slenderverse: An Artistic Movement"" from director Alex Hera reveals the hidden stories of how Slenderman was developed into a viral icon by these creators. Through never-before-seen archival content, access to the private community, and interviews with Chris Hammarberg and Heather Mooch of ""DarkHarvest00"", Dylan Sindelar of ""MLAndersen0"", Marissa Botelho of ""Tulpa Effect"", Lee Esposito of ""Whispered Faith"", Valeria Santiago of ""Stan Frederick"", as well Tim Sutton of ""Marble Hornets"", Evan Jennings of ""EverymanHYBRID"" and internet horror influencer Night Mind, the truth about this artistic movement - as well as the lives and relationships of these creators - is unveiled for the first time. The second film of ""Slenderverse: A Documentary Film Series"", a three film series which tells the dramatic history of the independent artists behind the Slenderverse movement and documents Slenderman's rise as an independent horror icon, and fall to the status of a dangerous internet meme through interviews with 19 internet horror legends, extensive live action reenactments, and exclusive archival content."

Slenderverse: The Rise and Fall of Slenderman,"In 2012, the horror character Slenderman exploded on the internet, becoming a beloved symbol across horror, video games, memes, independent art movements, and even Hollywood films.

'Slenderverse: The Rise and Fall of Slenderman' from director Alex Hera reveals new perspectives on how Slenderman developed into a viral icon, and how the artistic movement known as the Slenderverse was torn apart by a horrific true crime carried out in the name of the Slenderman, poorly received adaptations of the character, and the corruption of their movement from the inside. This is the story of the artists behind the icon... and the true, untold history of the Slenderman. The third film of ""Slenderverse: A Documentary Film Series"", a three film series which tells the dramatic history of the independent artists behind the Slenderverse movement and documents Slenderman's rise as an independent horror icon, and fall to the status of a dangerous internet meme through interviews with 19 internet horror legends, extensive live action reenactments, and exclusive archival content."

Sons,"It's a boy. March 16, 2016. Justin Simms has just become a dad. But his joy is tinged with unease. Little Jude enters the world at a time when traditional notions of masculinity are being contested as never before. How can he teach his boy to be a good man? With Sons, eight eventful years in the making, the Newfoundland-based filmmaker confronts the challenge with imagination and creative flair, crafting a big-hearted documentary essay on parenting, patriarchy-and the pain and pleasure of guiding boys through the turbulent cultural waters of the early 21st century. Woven throughout is luminous informal footage of Jude's early years, charting his trajectory from helpless newborn to hurricane of a boy, obsessed with dinosaurs and superheroes. How can fathers steer sons away from negative models of masculinity and help them become caring adults? What does it even mean to be a ""good man""? Isn't it enough to nurture basic human qualities-empathy, confidence, common decency-without dwelling on gender? Anchoring his enquiry in his home turf, a vibrant neighbourhood in downtown St. John's, Simms enlists the help of family, friends and an engaging gang of fellow dads, all grappling with the challenge of parenting boys. ""Masculinity can be beautiful,"" observes one participant, ""but it needs a new story now."" Making inventive use of archival imagery, Simms evokes a traditional maritime culture where men frequently were separated from their families, and in a series of soul-bearing conversations with his own father, he explores how ""masculinity"" can always be questioned, always be reimagined."

The plot unfolds in the Physics Department of the Sapienza University in Rome and the Virgo Research Center near Pisa, portraying the everyday life and routine of the international group of scientists. However, unlike an interview, their stories are communicated through dance - the endless performance smoothly flowing from working cabinets and laboratories to spacious halls and technical premises. The director Meritxell Campos Olivé, whose work as a filmmaker is deeply interspersed with her performative practice, has worked out very personal ways of movement with every protagonist in the film - the actual scientists that have never expressed themselves through dance and acting. In Surfing Einstein, community, intuition, continuous learning, imagination, and perseverance can be set against today's advancing egoism and hyper-individuality."

Tax Broke,"For decades, Baltimore has struggled to grow, hamstrung by a property tax rate twice that of the surrounding counties, a lack of affordable housing strategy, and lack of investment in education. The unequal burden has prompted the city to pursue a risky strategy of effectively paying developers to build. Using incentives with innocuous sounding acronyms like TIF and PILOT, new construction in the city has occurred largely at the expense of the city's working class. Meanwhile, despite the promises that these incentives would reverse the city's decline, Baltimore continues to lose population. How did we get here? Why is Baltimore the only jurisdiction in the state that must pay for development? And is there a better way to grow a city? These are just a few of the questions that Tax Broke seeks to answer. The film-five years in the making-explores the history of the city's fraught relationship with artificially imposed boundaries, codified segregation, and, finally, a political economy fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in tax incentives doled out behind closed doors."

Teilhard: Visionary Scientist,"This documentary, 13 years in the making, tells the story of an early 20th Century French Jesuit priest and scientist, who in relentless pursuit of the everlasting on earth, encounters fame, love, and implacable opposition from his church. Despite exile and lifelong censorship, his transformational insights into science and faith provide a prophetic legacy for our technological age. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was born in Auvergne region of France in 1881, fourth of eleven children. His father, owner of large rural estates, taught his son to appreciate nature; his mother who home schooled him gave him a deep spiritual grounding. But even as a young child, Pierre's discovery that his life was fragile put him on track to find something indestructible to depend on. He found that in secret iron treasures, until he discovered they rusted. Then he turned to stones, which led to a hobby of collecting stones and fossils, which then became a career in geology, layered on top of a vocation as a Jesuit priest. As a seminarian he finds that his love for the natural world runs counter to the spirituality he is taught, which is to find holiness by rejecting the world. This creates internal tension that lasts for years. After intense training in philosophy and theology as a seminarian, and three years assigned to teaching Muslim high schoolers in Cairo, Egypt, he is ordained a priest. Shortly before ordination he resolves his inner conflict about loving the world and loving God at the same time. It results in a very personal understanding of evolution that will determine the arc of the rest of his life. From there he is off to Paris, to study geology under the tutelage of the director of the National Museum of Natural History. He also ""comes up against the feminine"" he will write years later in his autobiography, forming a deep bond with his cousin Marguerite. Marguerite, his childhood playmate in Auvergne, is now in Paris as head of an elite girls' school. Pierre's studies are interrupted by the eruption of The Great War, to be known in history as World War I. He is called up for service for France. Entitled to an officer's rank as a chaplain, he asks instead to serve with the troops as a stretcher bearer. His service results in several medals for heroism. He remarkably is inspired to use all possible down time from the front to write essays, applying evolution to his spiritual life. Marguerite, in hundreds of letters, becomes his sounding board and soul mate. Surviving some 60 battles over 4 and a half years, Teilhard returns to Paris to finish his doctoral studies in science, and to become the head of the geology department at the Institut Catholique in Paris. Students love him, including new Jesuits in training. He loves to teach them about evolution. This leads an older Jesuit theologian to challenge Teilhard about the implications of evolution for the Church's doctrine of Original Sin. If Genesis was not historical, and there was not an actual Adam and Eve, then there could not have been Original Sin. Teilhard offers to write a paper about it, which he finishes shortly before accepting an invitation to participate in an expedition in China with a fellow Jesuit stationed there. His expedition with Emile Licent, SJ, is sponsored by Marcellin Boule, head of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. It is extraordinarily fruitful, resulting in 60 cases of fossils, many of which are still on display in the museum today. But Teilhard's exhilaration is short lived. Upon returning to Paris he is called in my his providincial superior in Lyon, who has been asked by the Jesuit Superior General in Rome, to account for a paper he has mysteriously received written by Teilhard on Original Sin. Teilhard is forced to sign a document that promises not to dispute Church teaching, is forbidden to write anything except scientific papers, is removed from his position at the Institut Catholique, and is exiled indefinitely to China. As Teilhard embraces his fate in China, he becomes a favorite among European and American scientists in Peking. He is put in charge of a newly formed Chinese Geological Survey seeking human origins in digs near Peking, and becomes world famous for his part in the discovery of Peking Man, the most important human fossil find in the world to that date, 1930. He is invited to become a visiting scholar at the American Museum of Natural History, and joins many other international expeditions in the east. In the meantime he produces volumes of scientific writings, along with spiritual essays he is not allowed to publish, along with two books, The Divine Milieu, and The Human Phenomenon. The beginning of World War II, and the Japanese occupation of Peking, ends this activity, placing Teilhard under house arrest. When the war is over Teilhard is finally permitted by his Jesuit superiors to return to France. Teilhard is well received by the scientific establishments and his old Jesuit friends, but the favor with which he is received makes Jesuit superiors all the more worried about his views on evolution. Teilhard is exiled a second time to New York City in 1951, where he will die in 1955. In the meantime, Teilhard has followed the advice of a local Jesuit superior to bequeath his prolific writings to a lay person so that they would be destroyed by the order after he dies. He wills them to a volunteer secretary, Mademoiselle Jeanne Mortier. Upon his death she immediately takes them to a publisher. Publications begin within the year, and by the early 1960s, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is a phenomenon in religious circles in many languages around the world. Today he is embraced as a prophet by both science and religion."

Tell Them About Us,"One of the most intangible yet defining procedures in life is none other than the passage from puberty to adulthood, an experience depicted in countless films and documentaries, though rarely with the emotional intelligence and unpretentious authenticity encompassed in this film. Except from imminent adulthood, the girls from Tell Them About Us also have to deal with another complicated condition; despite their Arab, Kurdish and Roma origins, they are growing up in a provincial town in Germany. Through this film (or, rather, actually through their very existence, their intoxicating energy, their bravery, their smiles, as well as their dreams), they are not just laying claim to their position in life but to a better future, speaking out about the way they live and the future they want to build with a genuinely hopeful outlook. Simple in its conception although an intricate result, Rand Beiruty's documentary is as close to the definition of ""slice of life"" as it can get; a slice that is rather delicious, flavorful, and juicy."

Cesare Pavese 'I mari del Sud'. It takes courage to bet on a dream. And it takes madness to think outside the box.

We discover that Teo the entrepreneur has remained a dreamer at heart, and is still that guy who had a vision and the determination to pursue it, and that behind a great name like 'Baladin' lies simplicity and genius of a man who is off the beaten track.

This is a documentary film showing the life of herdsmen in the Hulun Buir grassland, and it is also a work that is inspired by the relationship between human beings and nature. With the background of Xibo Mountain in the Xini River Grassland of Hulun Buir, the film focuses on the real work and living conditions of the nomadic herdsmen, including their beliefs and reverence for nature, in an all-around, multi-angle documentary video work. The origin of this film is based on Mr Duane Tongke's nearly half-century old friend, Hadar, who gave up his work and life in the city to return to his hometown and live with the Hulun Buir Buryat community. Mr. Duane Tongke, the filmmaker, and Hadar, the main character of the film, are childhood partners who met by chance thirty years apart in the Sini River grasslands, so the film starts with Hadar's childhood memories, and records Hadar's real life in the Hulun buir grasslands from a natural, objective and calm perspective, reflecting every aspect of Hadar's life after he returned to his hometown to become a herdsman, and elaborating on the life of nomadic herdsmen, which is not very common in the present-day society. It also gives a multi-dimensional account of the life of nomadic herders, a rare phenomenon in today's society."

The Chef & The Daruma,"Hidekazu Tojo's role in the creation of what is now known as the 'California Roll' helped introduce sushi to a western audience, and catapulted his name to celebrity status as sushi boomed in North America - but it wasn't always this way. When he came to Vancouver in the '70's he faced a staggering amount of racism from locals, while sushi was seen as bizarre and foreign. How much did Tojo have to change about himself and his food to fit in with his new community? We chronicle the hardships he faced, how he navigated them, and we follow his ongoing journey in search of identity. This is also the story of Daruma, an ancient fable about a Buddhist monk. The dolls made in his image are a traditional Japanese symbol of setting a goal, sticking to it, and getting back up when you fall. The film tracks the fable as a colorful, eye-catching parallel to Tojo's incredible story, and their shared theme of standing tall in the face of adversity."

The Empathizer,"In The Empathizer, director Fred Le travels to Vietnam to explore why his mother refuses to return to the homeland she left. There, he interviews a number of Vietnamese expatriates who have made a living in Vietnam, including artists, athletes, business owners, and students. Each discusses the contradictions between what they learned about Vietnam during their own Western upbringings and their experiences in present-day Vietnam. It might appear, at first, that The Empathizer is leaning so heavily on the views of the young Viet kieu (the Vietnamese diaspora) who emigrated back to Vietnam, but Le eventually returns to the source of why this film exists. And when he does, The Empathizer finds its emotional and moral center. Aptly titled, The Empathizer pushes the audience to consider the diverse viewpoints and experiences of the various Vietnamese diaspora approaches to Vietnam. It blends humor and gravity in articulating the lasting effects of division, suspicion and animosity borne out of war, forced migration, and politics. The film speaks directly to the children of Vietnamese refugees who seek to empathize with the tribulations of their parents, but often cannot fully grasp the effects of displacement-induced trauma. Highlighting the rift between generations, The Empathizer pushes the audience to explore ways to build empathy and understanding."

Although the image has been suggested to be a large artificial construction by an ancient society, the majority of scientists believe it to be an optical illusion created by natural geological features. In 2001, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor took another look at the face, using a much higher resolution camera, and saw ... no face. They claim that what had appeared to be a face is just another boring old Martian land formation, kind of like the land-forms that litter the U.S. Southwest (or is it)."

The Film After La Pel·lícula Després,"In 2019, after finishing his debut feature, immersing himself in a sick existential crisis as he sees how his work little by little becomes another consumer product, an independent filmmaker dedicates himself to documenting with a camera his experiences at international festivals where his movie is shown. The sudden appearance of the global epidemic will not only cause the cancellation of its theatrical release, but will lead him to be confined with his family in a house lost in the middle of nature, completely away from the noise of civilization. From the review of the filmed material, from everything that this loneliness proposes to him, from the confusion of the pandemic reality and from the vertigo of his own fears and uncertainties as a newborn artist, the possibility of making a new film emerges as a lifeline. Without direction or determined purpose, this project begins, which is discovered in the process itself as a confrontation between the very meaning of cinema and the phantasmagoria that emanates from the decay of that promise of a new world that has already become, inexorably, an image of himself."

I Could Not Believe It joyously chronicles the experiences of a young Black, queer creative finding their identity, voice and style decades before Barry Jenkins' (rather more downbeat) Moonlight. The Life of Sean DeLear is a vibrantly multi-faceted, buoyantly propulsive documentary portrait of this irresistibly charismatic one-off - sketched in celebratory but commendably clear-eyed style by writer-director Markus Zizenbacher. There can be very few people better qualified to do justice to this particular tale. Zizenbacher befriended DeLear - born Anthony Robertson in Simi Valley, an obscure California backwater - after the latter relocated to Vienna in the early 2010s. There the former front-person of Silver Lake post-punk-combo Glue reinvented themselves as a cabaret performer and collaborated with famed art-collective Gelitin before passing away aged just 52. ""SeanDe"" entrusted their treasure-trove audiovisual archive to Zizenbacher, who with co-editor Sebastian Schreiner has crafted an eclectic collage generously spiced with effervescent extracts from DeLear's own extensive video-diaries. These jagged hand-held snapshots bring back to often-hilarious life the electric days (and especially nights) from a quarter of a century ago, placed in retrospective context by present-day testimony from the survivors who knew SeanDe best and loved them the most. Sean DeLear - as in ""chandelier"" - lit up their world; Markus Zizenbacher now illuminates Sean DeLear for ours."

The Puppeteer,"""The Puppeteer "" tells the story of Siavash Sattari's efforts to revive and preserve the art of Kheimeh Shab-Bazi (traditional Persian puppetry), which has faded over time and was on the verge of being forgotten. Siavash Sattari, a puppeteer, has dreamed since his youth of having a mobile theater to perform this ancient, disappearing art form across Iran and the world. His dream comes true in Chabahar, where locals build a puppet theater truck, attaching it to a vehicle. With this first-ever traveling theater, Sattari and his team bring Kheimeh Shab-Bazi to various parts of Iran. As children watch the puppets in fascination, he also searches for someone to fill the void left by his daughter and apprentice, Saina, who has emigrated from Iran. This film is essentially a social documentary, addressing a pressing contemporary issue. It portrays Sattari's fight against the historical neglect of Kheimeh Shab-Bazi and traditional arts, striving to bring them back into the spotlight. It can also be considered a historical social documentary, as it delves into historical aspects of the art form. In the history of Iranian performing arts, the master-apprentice tradition has always played a significant role. Artistic skills were often passed down from father to son or through dedicated mentorship in various forms. In the traditional approach to learning, an individual had to develop the capacity to absorb the art before truly mastering it. However, it is crucial that these arts also adapt to contemporary needs. Siavash Sattari is not just a puppeteer but also a cultural promoter, working tirelessly to spread his art across the country and even to remote areas. The art of Kheimeh Shab-Bazi has a history of over a thousand years in Iran. The famous Persian poet Omar Khayyam, nearly 900 years ago, wrote: ""We are mere puppets, and the heavens the puppeteer, This is the truth, not just a metaphor."""

The Stand,"On a misty morning in the fall of 1985, a small group of Haida people blockaded a muddy dirt road on Lyell Island (then known as the Queen Charlotte Islands). After a century of colonialist rule, Haida culture was nearly obliterated, with language and traditions fading, and the land stripped of its resources. But a committed group of Haida and their supporters took a stand, demanding a stop to clear-cut logging practices that had destroyed salmon habitat and ravaged old-growth forest. In the face of overwhelming pressure from the RCMP, private logging interests and even the media, the defenders called for the government to work with Indigenous people to find a way to protect the land and the future. In a riveting new feature documentary drawn from more than a hundred hours of archival footage and audio, award-winning director Christopher Auchter (Now Is the Time (2019)) recreates the courage, tenacity and tension of this critical turning point. From furious showdowns between television pundit Jack Webster and Haida leader Miles Richardson, to the support of then-NDP MLA Svend Robinson, The Stand captures the struggle as it unfolds on a moment-to-moment basis. As a complex battle played out on remote logging roads, in the legal system and in the court of public opinion, authorities staged a steady propaganda campaign, alongside stalling tactics and a police presence, to undermine the Haida cause. With the whole world watching, would the Haida hold fast to their strategy of peaceful resistance, or would violence erupt? The parallels between past and present continue to resound, as the Lyell Island blockade laid the foundations for current land-claim treaties across Canada. From the Haida Nation's resolute act of vision and conscience emerged an unbreakable commitment to justice, solidarity and Indigenous sovereignty that echoes forth to this day."

The Trash Goes Out on Tuesday,"""The Trash Goes Out On Tuesday"" chronicles the extraordinary life of actress and comedian Tuesday Thomas: coming to grips with being Trans in the early 70s when there were no words, internet, books or television to show her what she was. She embarked on an arduous journey to find her own tribe and live her truth. With a biological father that tries to kidnap her, a predatory priest, and a mother who doesn't understand what is wrong with her son, Tuesday had to leave home to become the person she knew she was inside. She finds friends and foes in the LGBTQ+ community, the one place she should be safe but wasn't always. Doing shows to make money, she was getting hormones wherever she could: including black markets and shady doctors. All this at a time when trans health-care was 'unofficial' and deadly, if it existed at all. After all, the median age for trans women at the time was said to be only 35. After surviving sexual assaults, outing, drug addiction and more she thought she'd found happiness and got married in Vegas. However, her husband soon reveals himself to be a drug-addicted lunatic who leaves her sick and alone. Tuesday goes home to recover, where she reconnects with the family she once felt so alienated from. While trying to divorce her husband, he begins to stalk and harass her, chasing her across the country for almost a decade, including orchestrating a conspiracy to have her killed for the insurance money. Finally, after he gets deported back to Canada, Tuesday faces her final battle. The breast implants Tuesday had gotten over 20 years ago break and start poisoning her with silicone. Ultimately, due to inadequate health care, death-for-profit insurance companies, and Transphobia running rampant in health care, Tuesday is forced to flee the country to get the medical care she needs to survive. Following the COVID-19 lock-down, Tuesday triumphantly returns to the stage. She knows the only reason she has survived while so many of her kind have perished, is to make people happy and heal them through laughter. As Tuesday says, ""There aren't many trans women who are left at this age."" Tuesday shares her story so that future generations can learn from her rare wisdom, and to honor all her friends who have been lost along the way who are unable to share their own."

The Whiskey Film,"Traverse Cinema Studio presents The Whiskey Film, a visual collective of tales about those who work to define whiskey as well as themselves as they explore their craft. The key concept is that change occurs over time, not only in the whiskey itself but also in the lives of those who create it. Like the spirit in the distilling process, whiskey makers change under the pressures of their lives and within the context of their craft. Told in chapter episodic form, The Whiskey Film's characters illustrate the key influences of a great whiskey; roots, art, science, agriculture, aging, passion, tradition, focus, branding, education, and patience. Craft distilling, distilled down is an agricultural product. The more technology enters into our daily lives, the further we become removed from the process and the producers from where the products we consume every day come from. The importance of creating from your hands and the land is valued as a commodity instead of understood as a creative expression. Through the first light, over a dusty road, as the ashes of a bonfire from the previous night's tales told, swirl and dance through a faint breeze, the sun rises on a dusty field. The hazy dew point slowly begins its daily cycle from leaving the tips of each barley plant which seem to fade endlessly into the newly lit horizon. You can hear the bacon and eggs sizzling in the background and the rusty turning of an old piece of irrigation equipment. Cracks, texture, and grit consume the rusted beast that undergoes its morning maintenance before the rooster begins his routine. This is where the lives that we all live every day begin. On a farm, far away, desolate, and removed from the amplitude of a growing population. But silent, simple, and steadfast in maintaining this as their way of life."

To Be an Extra,"A charismatic young woman's intelligent film about making the leap from supporting roles in German TV dramas to play the leading role in her own life. A courageous piece of performative autofiction which invents its own rules as it unfolds. Berlin is the setting for young actress (and now filmmaker) Henrike Meyer's attempt to find a way into the film world. But To Be an Extra is not a self-absorbed career project disguised as a documentary. In a distinctly original move, Meyer instead puts herself at risk and disappears into the nameless supporting roles in adverts and German TV crime dramas she is offered. She is the policewoman in the background when the stars of a TV series solve a murder. And from her new perspective as an out-of-focus extra, she gains a new existential insight into the precarious life on the fringes of both the film industry and society. To Be an Extra is a film that invents its own rules along the way and becomes a piece of performative autofiction that keeps unfolding. Cracks appear in the fabric of reality and something new takes shape in a meta-filmic self-portrait about finding yourself by becoming someone else."

Tranq,"Kensington is your typical working class neighborhood of blue collar employees raising their children and striving for the American dream. It also happens to be the East Coast's largest open-air drug market and the neighborhood with the largest number of people experiencing homelessness in Philadelphia. When then 12-year old Wheeler McKiethen first visited the neighborhood on a cross-country roadtrip with his father, his curiosity was piqued. A close family friend had recently died from a lifetime of drug use, and he couldn't help but to see the humanity and pain in the faces of the neighborhood's unofficial residents. Despite the vast number of articles and documentaries featuring Kensington, none actually gave them a platform to speak their truth. And so, Wheeler embarked on a two-year journey to understand the experiences and struggles of those battling addiction through an underground immersion into their lives. In his debut film, Tranq provides a gripping window into the chilling realities of opioid addiction, homelessness, and societal disdain from the people who are living it. It intertwines hard-hitting facts with first-person narratives of individuals caught in the vortex of addiction. We meet people such as Kathy*, who has been battling addiction since being prescribed Percocet by her doctor as a teenager; Matty*, a recently homeless young man since losing his job during COVID layoffs; and Raul*, a man attempting to self-medicate his battle with cancer. Each of the over twenty conversations reveal common threads of pain, abuse, and mental illness.

Travailler Autrement,"How has working remotely reshaped not just our professional lives but our personal lives as well? The notion of ""nine-to-five"" that summarized the working world of millions from about the mid-twentieth century onward has undergone a radical shift in recent years. So long, water cooler; hello, videoconferencing. Still, the concept isn't new, though the abrupt way in which it has taken hold may make it seem otherwise. But that raises a question. With COVID-19 now behind us, knowing that the economy can get along just fine with an at-home workforce, should we go back to the office? Looking closely at a work model whose roots go back to the 1960s, Work Different examines the origins, impacts, upsides and uncertainties of remote work. With humor (and a touch of retro-futurist nostalgia!), the documentary re-frames a host of social issues by talking to experts, managers, researchers and workers across Canada and beyond.

US Charros,"After more than 80 years of arriving in the United States, charrería, Mexico's national sport, faces two of its most significant challenges: survival and growth. Year after year, American Union teams encounter personal, economic, and social challenges as they strive to reach the National Charrería, the highest charro competition in Mexico. The practice of charrería has spread from border states like California, Arizona, and Texas to more remote states such as Washington, Illinois, and Wyoming. This expansion has made the practice of charrería more challenging due to unfavorable weather conditions in these areas. The inclement weather makes it dangerous for both the rider and the horse to engage in the sport. The inequality faced by male and female charro competitors from the United States when they compete in Mexico needs an immediate solution. Unlike the Mexican teams, the American teams arrive at a disadvantage because they cannot bring their own horses, which are expensive and difficult to transport. As a result, they have to rent horses in order to compete effectively. US Charros is the first documentary about the sport of charreria in the United States, told through charros and escaramuzas who have immigrated to the northern border. Charreria in the United States has a promising future. Similar to the American rodeo, charreria possesses all the necessary elements to be an attractive spectacle and an opportunity for large commercial brands to find the perfect spot in which to invest."

He explores three foundational questions: Can nonviolence work in the larger social context? The loss of innocent children was devastating.. The story drew immediate national and international attention. The Amish community chose to forgive the murderer, who took his own life, by supporting his wife and family. She recalls what she experienced at the receiving end of forgiveness. What role do shared beliefs play in practicing nonviolence? In the late 1980s, 48 Senegalese Sufi Muslims were murdered while driving taxis. Rather than seek retribution, the Harlem Murid community chose to forgive as a manifestation of their commitment to nonviolence. Aisatou Ndao, an early member of the community, attributes this stance to her community and the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Shaykh Amadou Bamba. For this community, nonviolence, is a way of life, modeled to their children and taught in Qur'anic schools. What does it take to create a viable and sustainable culture of nonviolence? With more than 30 militias, Solo, Indonesia, was known as a violent city, a city with a ""short fuse."" Unexpected Peace documents the friendship between the commander of a fundamentalist Islamic militia and the pastor of a Christian church in Solo. In the two decades since this friendship began, the militia and the church continue to take on humanitarian work within and beyond Solo, as community-building actions replace violence."

Unorthodox Education,"In New York, home to nearly half of the world's Jewish population, tens of thousands of Jewish children are not receiving a basic education. They attend schools known as yeshivas that typically offer less than eight hours a week of secular instruction. Children often finish school without being able to read or write in English. Because of the extraordinary political power of ultra-Orthodox communities, their schools have never been required to comply with state law. Unorthodox Education lifts the curtain on these communities, revealing the human cost of actively depriving kids of knowledge. The 40-minute documentary, created by Jewish filmmakers, presents interviews with people who have left the ultra-Orthodox world as well as journalists, academics, and advocates. The film exposes the tragedy of forced ignorance hiding in plain sight in the biggest city in the United States."

Like many other British 20-somethings, Lucie planned to spend some time living in Japan to experience a different culture and way of life. She got a job as a hostess in a hostess bar, a unique piece of Japanese life based on the country's old geisha culture. Some Japanese men would visit the clubs after work to unwind and hostesses would pour the men drinks, chat to them about their day and sometimes sing karaoke with them. The job was well paid and appealed to young western travellers who could earn good money that allowed them to pay for their lives in such an expensive city and save for further travels. Lucie was enjoying her role and making new friends. Hostessing also allowed the hostesses to go on Dohan dates, companionship dates, before taking the men back to the bars for more drinks. After only a couple of months in Tokyo, Lucie left to go on a Dohan date with a mysterious man. But she didn't return to the club or her home in the city. Lucie had vanished...

They don't know how to be together. They have not learned to be. When they are in each other's presence, they wait for it to pass. It's not a mother and son. It is a man and a woman who find the time long. Who are there because it is, apparently, a mother's role to spend time with her son.

The few remaining specimens are kept alive in long artificial basins submerged in the forest, far from any danger, in tranquil water.

It tells the collective story of young researchers and volunteers dedicated to safeguarding life, habitat, and culture, part of their territory. It contrasts the physicality of a wall that obstructs and divides with the apparently fragile but resilient nature. It does so through the eyes of the sturgeon, showing the challenges it must overcome in a corrupted habitat. It's a symphony of water, nature, and small actions that change the world."

Vocea Dreptilor,"Following its departure, the passenger ship NR MOGOSOAIA encountered a devastating collision with the convoy led by the BRP PETER KARAMINCEV pusher. This tragic event resulted in the sinking of NR MOGOSOAIA and the loss of 214 passengers who perished in the Danube's waters. Grindu Commune is located near the border with the former U.S.S.R (present-day Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova), on Tulcea banks, at Cotul Pisicii (The Cat's Bend). The all-time strategical importance of this area is also indicated by the presence in the immediate proximity of an important Roman castrum (Dinogetia) The highest location of the commune is called ""Popina"", a latin term meaning ""the place where the poor eat"". Therefore, we are talking about a settlement with a history of thousands of years, documented by the name of the stone and preserved as oral history. From immemorial times, Grindu Commune has been a predominantly fishing village settled along the Danube bend, surrounded, until 1989, by a delta of overwhelming beauty, the locals tell us. As fate would have it, in the summer of 1989, when the village counted 440 families (about 1550 souls), the delta was artificially drained, as the satellite images of the area show. Until that very moment, these families were numerous thanks to the fish they abundantly caught in the delta. The village was wild and isolated. On rainy days, when it flooded, people would take their children to school by boat. There was no question of finding food, as there was the case for those who lived in cities during the communist regime. The people of Grindu (grindenii) or the cat's people (pisicanii), as they were called in the olden days, tell us that they used to reach out in the garden to catch fish with their bare hands, without any fishing net. During winter, when the Danube froze, people would cross to the ship on ice floes. If anyone happened to fall in, they were helped with a pole and pulled back onto the steaming ice. Conditions were difficult, as the village was not connected to the power system until late, in 1989. These people had their children sent to Galati to work. And so it came to pass that on Sunday, 10th September 1989, a week before the school year began, they were drowned on the bottom of the Danube; together with them, the people attending a wedding and a baptism - on the day of the autumn harvest, on a passenger ship loaded more than ever over the year. It is impossible to imagine the terror that collectively overtook them, during those days, both the victims and the survivors of this event. 1 of 10 people of Grindu died instantly, some of whom were never to be found. The effect was comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, and the consequences can still be felt today, three decades later, in the stories of those left behind."

Walk the Line,"Literally translated from Zou Xian in Mandarin, ""Walk the Line'' is a gripping phenomenon that has gone viral on Chinese social media, referring to the trek across the Darién Gap, a dangerous stretch of jungle connecting Colombia and Panama. Tens of thousands of asylum seekers from across the globe are braving the journey to reach the United States. As a result of China's harsh Zero-COVID policies, economic downturn, and a looming threat to human rights, Chinese migrants are fleeing the world's second-largest economy, quickly becoming the fastest-growing group descending upon the US southern border. The documentary is an on-the-ground, intercontinental chronicle of this treacherous journey. Walk the Line features intimate stories of several migrants: Ivan and Lee, a same-sex couple who did not dare reveal their faces to the camera until they reached the US, hoping that their story will inspire China's oppressed LGBTQ+ community; Cindy, the only female migrant that agreed to be on-camera, who suffered extreme physical challenges in the jungle and a nine-day nightmare at the border, grappling with unemployment and loneliness, and contemplating the sacrifices made in pursuit of a better life; and Mr. Yu who, after enduring a year of van-dwelling in Beijing to evade strict lockdowns, believes this difficult journey is the best choice he has ever made. He gets baptized in a Los Angeles church, and learns English at a community college, aspiring to become a truck driver. Over the course of eight months, ""Walk the Line"" captures these migrants' extraordinary resilience and determination, and the complex journey that follows their choice. Through stunning cinematography and poignant interviews, the documentary sheds light on the profound toll of the migrant journey against the inescapable backdrop of China's tense geopolitical setting and human right crisis."

War on Education,"Ukraine has rightfully received widespread news coverage since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Most of the information has been about the military operations, the humanitarian crisis and international affairs. Not much attention has been given to the ideology behind the invasion and the role of education in this conflict. By mixing micro-stories of brave teachers, and an in-depth analysis of the education system by authorities, academics, and NGOs, ""War on Education"" investigates the current situation of the school system and the historical reform happening in a time of war. The misuse of history by Putin, including the introduction of a single history schoolbook and the systematic attacks on education, is the result of an ancient strategy that finds its origins in the times of the Tsars. The Russian army is systematically targeting Ukrainian educational institutions and state actors deny Ukrainian identity and right to exist as a Nation. This is happening because they know that education is a weapon they have been using to impose their views on past, present and future generations... Ukrainians' resilience shows what a people can do if they are united to change things. The film tells a story that, while only touched on the surface by major international newspapers, urges mainstream attention."

Watch Me,"Utopia comes from the Greek Utopus and means ""no place"". Utopia by Cata Vassalo was born to bring fashion closer to entertainment and highlight the importance of each person's personality. The models have names and personalities of their own, and they also have the freedom to interpret their look in the way that best represents them and how they feel they should convey it. A fashion show becomes a moment of celebration, spectacle, and surprises, bringing together models, public figures, the corporate world, and creative industries in one moment followed by a party and preceded by various immersive experiences linked to dream and utopia. Utopia combines all of this but also brings together brands that are usually perceived as competitors, showing that each talent, personality, and company is unique and has differentiating factors that can be united. It is called Utopia because it was born from disbelief. The idea that it was impossible to create something like this in Portugal, that the budget would not be sufficient, that it would not attract people, the press, and talents, that it would not have an audience or interest, that it would not be appealing to partners. After a surprising first edition, Utopia by Cata Vassalo returns in 2024 to establish itself as a moment where everything is possible. Watch Me is the motto of this second Utopia, and it is a response that we should all give to disbelief and fears - both from others and our own. Is it not possible? Is it Utopia? Watch Me! The documentary combines all the live-recorded moments of the fashion show with behind-the-scenes footage of a year of manual work in creativity, jewelry, and textiles by 12 women who make up the Cata Vassalo brand. It also takes us behind the scenes of what this event is, created by people who never fit into traditional standards and formats and whose experiences in organizing events - both audiovisual and fashion - were non-existent. In this documentary, we are also invited to hear some of the main names of the show - models and public figures - reflecting on what Utopia makes them feel and how the message of empowerment and that everything is possible with work, dedication, and dreams materializes on this day. Watch Me is about breaking barriers. About mannequins who are actually people. About having personalities on the runway who traditionally would never walk for a brand. About dreaming and making it real. About synergies between brands and talents. About meticulous work and dedication. About creativity. About Portuguese talent in so many areas. About taking people with us to fulfill a dream. About being seen as we are and about giving a stage for others to be seen and valued. Watch Me is an ode to dreams that come true. A journey from Utopia to reality."
Watching you - Die Welt von Palantir und Alex Karp,"For the first time, a documentary examines US entrepreneur Alex Karp and his mysterious and insular company, Palantir. Along with Elon Musk, his co-founder Peter Thiel, and Sam Altman, the CEO of Palantir is considered one of the most important digital leaders. Like them, Karp is benefiting from the election of Donald Trump as US president. But he is still relatively unknown in this country - even though German police authorities also work with Palantir's software, Gotham. The successful yet controversial data analysis program specializes in bundling and visualizing large amounts of data for the purpose of intelligence gathering and surveillance. Gotham can create profiles of individuals worldwide through digital data analysis. The software supports intelligence agencies, the military, and police authorities, the latter also in Hesse and Bavaria, with information that can be used, for example, in the fight against terrorism - or for targeted killings. Palantir is currently an important partner of Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. The company rose to prominence through its work for the CIA and NSA. With their help, Osama Bin Laden is said to have been brought down. In 2024, Palantir was temporarily valued at over $220 billion on the stock market. One founder, Peter Thiel, is a right-wing libertarian and Trump supporter. The other, Alex Karp, describes himself as a ""neo-Marxist and leftist,"" holds a doctorate in philosophy from Frankfurt, and likes to mention that his parents were ""hippies."" He even offers Thai Chi classes for his employees - and teaches them himself. Today, he leads the world's largest commercial surveillance company as CEO. Forbes estimates his net worth at $9.7 billion. The film takes a look at one of the most mysterious and powerful men of our time."

À hauteur d'enfant,"As filmmakers who became parents in a North American suburb, we asked ourselves how to explain life to our children. Searching for answers, we grabbed our camera and immersed ourselves for nearly four years in our children's world-a realm where each small act is extraordinary and where each story remains untold. Little Béatrice, with her boundless 3-year-old energy, plunges us into her lively world of make-believe. While her elder brother Émile, now learning to read and write, begins to ask questions like, ""Are atoms alive?"" Gradually, Émile also shows an interest in his father's camera. Through a mix of observational style and lyrical visuals from a child's point of view, this cinematographic journey prompts us to reflect: What do we lose as we grow up? And what stories of life do we wish to pass down to them?"
