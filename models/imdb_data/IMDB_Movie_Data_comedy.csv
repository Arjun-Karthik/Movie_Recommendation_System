Im Haus der alten Augustin,"Österreich, 1986. Es ist das Jahr der Waldheim-Wahl, doch Künstler Albin (Gerald Pribek) hat andere Sorgen. Erst offenbart ihm sein Kollege Sir Tralala (David Hebenstreit himself), dass der von Albin praktizierte Naturalismus seit 100 Jahren tot ist und die Moderne übernommen hat, dann macht auch noch seine Freundin Ida (Lisa-Carolin Nemec) mit ihm Schluss. Beim Versuch, Ida zurückzuerobern, steht Albin deren jagdbegeisterter Vater Dr. Hampapa (Clemens Aap Lindenberg) im Weg, der ihn nicht ausstehen kann und nicht nur gerne Hasen schießt. Bis sich zum toten Naturalismus ein toter Naturalist gesellt, der sich dann doch als jemand anderer herausstellt - und die Dinge immer gruseliger werden. Wie es eben geht, wenn man etwas zu tief hinter gutbürgerliche Fassaden blickt. Im Haus der alten Augustin beginnt lustig und endet ernsthaft. Oder eher: beginnt mit Kunst und endet im Blut. Doch waren Spaß und Ernst, Kunst und Blut je wirklich getrennt? Ist, in einem Land wie Österreich, das Verrückte nicht immer schon das Authentische und umgekehrt? Man nehme das Hermann-Nitsch-Bild, das sich Dr. Hampapa ins Esszimmer gehängt hat, weil er, wie er sagt, es sich leisten kann. Albin, der als ""Naturalist"" Nitsch verachtet, empört sich: ""Einen Kübel Blut über die Leinwand schütten und für eine Million Schilling an irgendwelche Kunstbanausen verkaufen? Da scheiß ich drauf, Oida."" Die Blutorgie der modernen Kunst wird zum Vorboten eines Schreckens, der im Patriarchen Dr. Hampapa seine perfekte Verkörperung findet. Und ist der gespenstisch-strenge Herr mit dem komischen Namen nicht auch ein Wiedergänger des Ex-Nazis Kurt Waldheim, der es gerade darauf anlegt, sich zum Präsidenten der Republik wählen zu lassen? Währenddessen strebt die Generation von Albin und Ida in die Zukunft: Der lässige, improvisiert wirkende Wiener Künstler:innenslang klingt ganz nach unserem Hier und Jetzt.

RiffTrax: Fight to Win,"The first question you'd have if you met a talking, glowing outer space rock would probably be ""Can you lick things?"" Once you were assured that, of course, it could, you'd probably want to know: ""Do you have other protuberances that extend outward and throb in a suggestive manner?"" After it demonstrated this off-putting ability, you'd probably say, ""Terrific. You'll be perfect for my new children's movie!"" As tends to happen in this type of movie, Cynthia Rothrock shows up to kick guys. We assume because they questioned the rock's ability to lick things, but we're not entirely certain. The rock can also cause hallucinations and turn your hands into feet. Sorry, the rock turned our hands into feet there. We won't question its abilities again. Anyway, Fight To Win is like someone said ""Let's make a Kung Fu The Goonies, but if the kids were, like, really in actual danger. Not the characters, the actual child actors."" It's zany, it's action-packed, and it's got one of the most insane Final Act Twists we've ever encountered at RiffTrax, and keep in mind, The Ice Cream Bunny showing up on a fire truck was one of the Final Act Twists we've encountered. Look, we all know you stopped reading this and bought it after we mentioned the rock with a tongue. But in case you're pretending to read the rest just so your family doesn't think you're a weirdo, please join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for Fight To Win."
RiffTrax: Micro Mini Kids,"Micro Mini Kids is the story of Josh, a teenager who's a little bit short and completely obsessed with that fact. He's also an inventor, so, right about now you're probably guessing he accidentally shrinks himself further with an invention of his own. Wrong. He does invent a little submarine, but the accidental shrinking comes much later and not by his own hand. Josh spends most of the movie making the same nervous, perplexed face while trying to win over a girl who clearly likes him already. It all culminates in the longest party scene ever committed to film, as Josh navigates the goofy little submarine he invented through the bloodstream of the slightly taller kid who bullies him. If all this sounds like it doesn't quite add up, David DeCoteau apparently agreed with you. It's from 2001 but it's really a '90s movie, so there's hacking performed on an iMac with virtual reality goggles, a friend who looks like teenage Kramer, and so much more. Hop in a micro mini submarine and ride through the neural pathways of Mike, Kevin and Bill for the fantastic voyage that is Micro Mini Kids."

Each discusses the contradictions between what they learned about Vietnam during their own Western upbringings and their experiences in present-day Vietnam. It might appear, at first, that The Empathizer is leaning so heavily on the views of the young Viet kieu (the Vietnamese diaspora) who emigrated back to Vietnam, but Le eventually returns to the source of why this film exists. And when he does, The Empathizer finds its emotional and moral center. Aptly titled, The Empathizer pushes the audience to consider the diverse viewpoints and experiences of the various Vietnamese diaspora approaches to Vietnam. It blends humor and gravity in articulating the lasting effects of division, suspicion and animosity borne out of war, forced migration, and politics. The film speaks directly to the children of Vietnamese refugees who seek to empathize with the tribulations of their parents, but often cannot fully grasp the effects of displacement-induced trauma. Highlighting the rift between generations, The Empathizer pushes the audience to explore ways to build empathy and understanding."
