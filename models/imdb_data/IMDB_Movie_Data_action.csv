Two groups of cousins from the same royal family, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, vie for control of the Kingdom. Although descended from two brothers who live in peace, Dhritarashtra and Pandu, the cousins' rivalry leads to death and destruction and jeopardizes the very fabric of the universe. Born blind, Dhritarashtra, the elder brother, sits on the throne. His sons, the Kauravas, led by the ambitious and envious Duryodhana, seek to maintain their hold on power. In contrast, Pandu's sons, the Pandavas, led by the righteous Yudhishthira, seek to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs, and nothing more. The conflict between the two families intensifies over time, fuelled by jealousy, greed, and betrayal. The story weaves through a rich tapestry of events, including an infamous game of dice in which Yudhishthira loses his kingdom and freedom. The Pandavas find themselves in exile until their eventual return to fight and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. After years of tension and conflict, the only possible resolution is a battle of epic proportions, in which warriors of unparalleled strength destroy each other in a clash over the fate of the kingdom. Led by the noble Arjuna and guided by the divine Krishna, the Pandavas face off against their cousins, teachers, and friends on the battlefield. The war is not merely a clash of armies but a moral and philosophical struggle, testing in each person the principles of righteousness and duty. In the end, the Pandavas emerge victorious, but victory comes at a heavy price. The war leaves behind a trail of destruction and loss, leaving them and us to question the very nature of victory and the true cost of power."

Tega is a socially conscious young man who quickly realizes that his family business is a cesspit of corruption and a hub of everything wrong with Nigeria, particularly in the power sector. His closest friends-Bob, Ken, and Jez-come from more humble backgrounds but are not spared from the effects of energy corruption in high places. A damaged power transformer in their ghetto neighborhood leads to a series of tragic incidents, culminating in the loss of a child during childbirth. In reaction, the residents rise in protest against agents of the power company who come to disconnect their electricity due to unpaid debts. During a scuffle, one of the agents falls, hits his head on the ground, and dies. Meanwhile, a gathering of Chief Dagogo's friends reveals they are the juggernauts controlling Nigeria's energy sector-from generator importation to diesel supply, and across the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the oil industry, among other areas. Tega soon clashes with the company when he uses his position to intervene in the police case arising from the death of the power company agent. This intervention brings more trouble for Tega, who subsequently uncovers secrets indicating that his family business is deeply entangled in the organized crime that dominates Nigeria's oil, gas, and power sectors. Determined to dismantle the corrupt power behemoth at all costs-even if it jeopardizes his family's fortunes-Tega enlists the help of his friends. However, their efforts are soon discovered by the underworld power brokers and movers in the energy sector, who are connected to ruthless global oil cartels. Tega and his friends are lured into a trap and imprisoned in a warehouse in the middle of nowhere. Their only hope of survival lies in Abo, the only daughter of Chief Dagogo, and Bozzo, the leader of an independent private army maintained by Tega's mother. Will they survive this perilous mission, which pits this small David against the Goliath of international oil cartels operating in Nigeria's power sector?"
