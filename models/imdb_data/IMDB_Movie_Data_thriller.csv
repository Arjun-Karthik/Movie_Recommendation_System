Im Haus der alten Augustin,"Österreich, 1986. Es ist das Jahr der Waldheim-Wahl, doch Künstler Albin (Gerald Pribek) hat andere Sorgen. Erst offenbart ihm sein Kollege Sir Tralala (David Hebenstreit himself), dass der von Albin praktizierte Naturalismus seit 100 Jahren tot ist und die Moderne übernommen hat, dann macht auch noch seine Freundin Ida (Lisa-Carolin Nemec) mit ihm Schluss. Beim Versuch, Ida zurückzuerobern, steht Albin deren jagdbegeisterter Vater Dr. Hampapa (Clemens Aap Lindenberg) im Weg, der ihn nicht ausstehen kann und nicht nur gerne Hasen schießt. Bis sich zum toten Naturalismus ein toter Naturalist gesellt, der sich dann doch als jemand anderer herausstellt - und die Dinge immer gruseliger werden. Wie es eben geht, wenn man etwas zu tief hinter gutbürgerliche Fassaden blickt. Im Haus der alten Augustin beginnt lustig und endet ernsthaft. Oder eher: beginnt mit Kunst und endet im Blut. Doch waren Spaß und Ernst, Kunst und Blut je wirklich getrennt? Ist, in einem Land wie Österreich, das Verrückte nicht immer schon das Authentische und umgekehrt? Man nehme das Hermann-Nitsch-Bild, das sich Dr. Hampapa ins Esszimmer gehängt hat, weil er, wie er sagt, es sich leisten kann. Albin, der als ""Naturalist"" Nitsch verachtet, empört sich: ""Einen Kübel Blut über die Leinwand schütten und für eine Million Schilling an irgendwelche Kunstbanausen verkaufen? Da scheiß ich drauf, Oida."" Die Blutorgie der modernen Kunst wird zum Vorboten eines Schreckens, der im Patriarchen Dr. Hampapa seine perfekte Verkörperung findet. Und ist der gespenstisch-strenge Herr mit dem komischen Namen nicht auch ein Wiedergänger des Ex-Nazis Kurt Waldheim, der es gerade darauf anlegt, sich zum Präsidenten der Republik wählen zu lassen?

Ein Horrorthriller mit massivem Schmäheinschlag, in dem zwischen 1986 und heute nur ein Wimpernschlag liegt - das gibt es in dieser Form auch nur ""made in Austria""."
