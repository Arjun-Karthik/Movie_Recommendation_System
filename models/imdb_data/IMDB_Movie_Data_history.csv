"Bearing Witness, Native American Voices in Hollywood","For over 100 years, Hollywood cinema has crafted the ultimate ""villain""-the Indian, as they were labeled in early Westerns. Confined almost exclusively to this genre, the Western became a vehicle for American racism, obscuring the genocide upon which the United States was built. For more than four decades, these films glorified ""Manifest Destiny"" and the conquest of so-called ""wild"" lands, with little regard for those who stood in the way. It wasn't until the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s that a shift occurred. A new wave of films, such as Little Big Man and Soldier Blue, emerged, offering more authentic portrayals of Native Americans and acknowledging the horrific massacres they endured. In this documentary, only Native Americans are given a voice to share their story, one that has been overshadowed by Hollywood's portrayal. Their narrative, part of the larger American story, highlights how cinema has long been used as a powerful propaganda tool, distorting history and perpetuating harmful stereotypes."

Part historical ""true crime"" story - part meditation on land and belonging in America - CALICO REBELLION is a meditation on small town American history, identity, idealism and the violence that percolates beneath the surface."

Through the lives of Emma and Alfred Freese, a fictional working-class family from Kiel, the challenges of that time are brought to life in all their harshness. Emma is a typical housewife and mother of that time. This time of hardship is seen through her eyes and the Freeses' struggle for a life of dignity is followed. The war and its deprivations have left their mark on this generation, but now things are looking up again. But when her husband Alfred collapses ill at the Howaldtswerft shipyard in Kiel, Emma despairs. He has to take it easy, but how is the family supposed to get by without wages? This cannot go on. In October 1956, up to 34,000 metal workers in the shipyards and factories of Schleswig-Holstein went on strike in the fight for justice and dignity. To this day, this strike is considered the longest in Germany. Employers and politicians stood in the way of the strikers with decisive force. On the employer side of the then booming shipbuilding industry was shipyard boss A. Westphal.

Holdin' Weight: The Darryl Reed Story,"In the 1980's, Darryl ""Lil' D"" Reed became the youngest and most successful rock-cocaine dealer on the mean streets of Oakland, California. Darryl was raised in and taught the street hustle game at an early age, by the most noteworthy street legend in the history of the Bay Area, Felix Mitchell. Felix gave young Darryl the codes of the streets and warned him that if Darryl chose to live the life of a gangster, then he must also clearly understand and follow the codes as rules and live by them. Darryl and his crew would later become an off-shoot version of the 69th Village MOB, which stood for My Other Brother. At the age of 13, Darryl witnessed the older members of the MOB being brought down by the FBI. Later that night he learned that Felix was also arrested. Within months after the arrest of the older members of the MOB, a new drug called crack-cocaine came to the forefront of America's problems and Oakland and Darryl Reed were in the middle of it. Darryl was introduced to the cocaine sales game by his friend, Rick and the two boys invested in the drug. The rest is what they say legends are made of, money, power and women. What separated Darryl from others was that he got the money and power before the age of 20. Small in stature, young Darryl was large in the streets and a millionaire. Inside you will read about his journey."

Il domani era venuto. Ricordare e non dimenticare,"In 1943, Elio and Pio are friends. They met years earlier in Padola, in the Dolomites. Pio was born there. Elio spends the summer there, forgetting the capital for a while. During the holidays, they go into the woods, laugh, and have fun. They don't know that the adventures of '43 will be their last together. Elio returns to Padola only after the war ends and discovers that Pio was killed in a clash with partisans. Pio, whose code name was Brusco, will never see the future of freedom for which he left his home, his family, and his friends. Elio does not forget his mountain friend and tells the story, weaving his memories with the events of World War II and the Resistance. The story of a mushroom-picking backpack that turns into the suitcase of a boy armed with antifascist ideals flows alongside the memory of the call to arms. A race to secretly distribute leaflets to help political prisoners blends with a run through alpine meadows with the wind messing up their curls. The carefree days at first and then the strong antifascist ideals follow the course of History and become a shared heritage. A heritage to pass on so as not to forget. Based on book ""Tomorrow has came, a partisan story between Rome and the Dolomites"" by Erica Silvestri. The friendship of two young men: Bruno who lives in the capital and Pio who lives in the mountains of Padola, bound by a deep friendship and a destiny of struggle and love. Their story begins on September 8, a day that will change their lives and those of many Italians who decide to fight Nazism and Fascism. This is the story of friendship and resistance.

On Moral Grounds,"Shot on location in Eastern Europe and in the courtrooms of the United States, this documentary brings to light the saga of WWII restitution and the stories of those who have sought justice for half a century. One man, Adolf Stern, takes us on an emotional journey that mirrors similar quests by thousands of other Holocaust survivors. After being liberated from Buchenwald, Adolf, penniless, traveled to Prague to redeem his father's life insurance. Rather than being consoled as a survivor of unspeakable horrors, he was thrown out of the insurance company office. He was told: ""No death certificate, no insurance claim."" Not until 1996 did the matter arise again. Adolf's niece, attorney Lisa Stern, heard the story through family members. Lisa teamed up with the pioneer of bad faith insurance law, William Shernoff, and set off on an incomparable legal odyssey. Against all odds, the two lawyers were determined to right the wrong perpetrated on Adolf and other survivors by insurance companies, which were supposed to take care of their policyholders in times of need. This David and Goliath account explores how persistence and powerful advocacy can achieve justice for wrongs committed half a century ago in a foreign land."

It is a time of war. But, remember, that war was not your choice, even if it became your only and biggest problem overnight. How do you save the lives of children, how do you make wise moves? The war is imposed on you, and you are not prepared because you were not expecting it. Who are you fighting against, who should you be afraid of? Your best man, a colleague who has been a friends since elementary school, or at least you thought as much? A close friend with whom you spent countless summer evenings at the river bank of your city, charming the most beautiful women? All of them, or almost all. Everyone...took off their masks and showed their true face. The face of a beast who, with bloody eyes, attacks its prey. You have become their prey, and the only reason is that you did not belong to the same religion that the evildoers believe they belong to. In their bloody attack, they treated nothing as holy: women, children, old and weak, in their eyes became legitimate targets that should be eliminated regardless of means. Because we value love and peace almost above all, we want to talk about war. War is a demonic force that is easy to start, but difficult to extinguish. The price that we pay is large, indescribable. If you would like to join us, shoulder to shoulder, together we can awaken a consciousness for coexistence, love, tolerance, and peace. Support this project and enable us to translate this true story to the film screen, to be shared with you and future generations. The story will leave nobody indifferent, and will leave a lasting mark on our souls, something that will never fade."
