Someone who can be tired, frustrated and even short-tempered, but also sensitive, sensitive and attentive to others. Thanks to this, we can identify with him and try to understand his emotions. The longer the film's viewers observe the hero, the more clearly they ask themselves the question - what is the true price of greatness? How much must be sacrificed for it? Are we witnesses of a chase or an escape? What role does the fear of stopping, of the end of existence, play here? Is the desire for perfection and the desire to give meaning to each day and each hour also an attempt to answer the question - what will I leave behind?"

L'amore e la gloria - La giovane Deledda,"Grazia Deledda's artistic character was formed in the twelve years between 1888 and 1900. The film recounts this development, from the time she published her first story, ""Sangue Sardo,"" in the magazine ""L'ultima Moda,"" at the age of seventeen, to her move to Rome, the desired destination of her youthful dreams. The events and incidents of this period, recounted in her posthumous autobiographical book, Cosima, can also be found in the extensive correspondence Deledda exchanged with many people, primarily men, with whom she almost always established a dynamic of seduction, with whom she sometimes ended up falling in love, and who, in some cases, fell in love with her. Virtual loves without ever having met in person, but which alienated the girl's desire for escape and made her dream of love. Deledda conveys her early amorous turmoil, passions, and disappointments in her debut stories, with a raw and mannered style. She translates her thoughts from the language she usually uses at home, Logodurese, into Italian, with considerable difficulty.. Her education was limited to the fourth grade, and she was primarily self-taught. However, she was sustained by great determination and a vivid imagination, aided by the novels she found at home and managed to obtain. With great willpower, she overcame the obstacles of a conventional family situation, which saw the publication of her early writings as a source of embarrassment in the small community of Nuoro at the time. She avidly absorbed the tales the servants told on long winter evenings around the fire and intensely experienced the wild ruggedness of the nature surrounding Nuoro, internalizing its spirit. These were the sources from which her fervent imagination drew to write her stories and her first novels, particularly La via del male, which reflected her upbringing in the Barbagia region. By now quite well-known, she fell madly in love, and only through correspondence, with a Sardinian literary critic living in Rome, Stanis Manca, and suffered humiliation when, after coming to Nuoro to meet her, he called her mediocre, criticizing her literary aspirations.With her determination, she transforms this disappointment into strength, transforming Stanis Manca from a potential lover into an adversary to whom she must prove her worth. With the publication of her first youthful novels, her literary value is gradually recognized both in Sardinia and beyond. The film ends when, in 1900, she meets Palmiro Madesani, an obscure civil servant who, in her eyes, has the great merit of being able to take her to Rome where, as she longs, she can participate in the celebration of life."

Mary Pickford's Kiss,"In July 1926, at the height of their fame, Hollywood stars Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks made a historic visit to the Soviet Union. Their arrival coincided with the death of the founder of the Cheka, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and, ironically, their hotel was located next to the Hall of Columns, where his body lay in state. The atmosphere took on a nearly surreal quality, as crowds alternated between mourning the Soviet leader and joyfully welcoming the Hollywood stars. Despite the brevity of their stay, Pickford and Fairbanks left an indelible mark on the hearts of Soviet admirers-poets wrote verses, and musicians composed songs in their honor. Director Sergei Komarov even managed to film the comedy Mary Pickford's Kiss, starring Igor Ilyinsky and Anel Sudakevich in the lead roles. However, just a few years later, the silent film era would come to an end, and the world-renowned Pickford would find herself an unneeded actress. This story serves as a reflection on life, talent, fame, time, and fate."

Neizvestnaya Tsvetaeva,"""Neizvestnaya Tsvetaeva"" is a portrait film. From the outset, the director aimed to create it in the finest traditions of Soviet documentary cinema, evoking nostalgia for the past that still echoes in the present. The lingering, measured pace of the shots and the narrative underscore the contemplative nature of the central figure, drawing the viewer into her reflective musings and stories. In the Silver Age, time was perceived differently, and the director sought to convey this unique sense of time to today's audience. One of the key motivations for making the film was to capture the ""vanishing generation""-those who personally knew Anastasia Tsvetaeva - while also unveiling the lesser-known pages of the writer's life, igniting public interest in this remarkable historical figure. The director found it especially intriguing that the Tsvetaeva sisters were part of the golden youth of the Silver Age. It was fascinating to explore what occupied their minds, their views, interests, and how they, having lost their mother early on and soon after all their wealth, managed to persevere through adversity."

The Truth, The Journey Within is a living message for humanity unpacked in a docu-drama about a family and the complexities within relationships and life. No one has escaped the suffering within the core shared wounds of separation we all share from living enslaved within the false programming and lies of separation. The Truth reveals the self-mastery wisdom and tools as a direct path to our individual and collective liberation, as our liberation is bound to one another, which is all part of The Divine Plan of Our Great Awakening in this Golden Age of Miracles upon us. The Truth is the invitation to reclaim the truth of who you are, of who we are, beyond our conditioning. Can The Truth set you free? As you shatter the illusions of ""identities,"" what reveals experientially will be the limitations and false beliefs holding you in unbeneficial relationship patterns and cycles. Your Self-mastery lives within ""the gap"" of no mind, between stimulus and response. Beyond identity is pure awareness. This re-membering is your true unborn Creation Blueprint.

As you reclaim your Divine sovereign authority, you'll begin mastering how to create ""the gap"" between your trigger and reaction. There is no secret, there's only The Truth. The Truth is our epic love story in the making. Begin the journey and discovery of your lifetime."

Zwischengeschoss C2 Das Stuttgart Modell von Wolfgang Frey,"Zwischengeschoss C2 sheds light on the life, work and reception of the late model railway builder Wolfgang Frey, who quietly and secretly created a globally unique model world of Stuttgart's city centre, including a signal box, on 350 square metres during his lifetime, which gained some fame posthumously. A unique testimony to the city of Stuttgart and, for some, one of the most important works of art in post-war Germany. For our film, we accompany the current owner of the model installation, Rainer Braun, on his mission to make Wolfgang Frey's work accessible to a wider audience. We draw on archive material to trace the history of its creation. Comparing the model world with the real Stuttgart. Talking to admirers, fans, companions and contemporary witnesses. And we look at various works of art that were created in the course of our dialogue with the work. The result is a filmic reflection on a globally unique model installation, in which we try to fathom the fascination for Wolfgang Frey's work."
