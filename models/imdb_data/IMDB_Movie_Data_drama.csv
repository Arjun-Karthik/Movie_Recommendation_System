The farmstead of Oru is run by Pearu's son Karla and his wife Iida. Both dislike each other mainly because this has been the way of the Robber's Hill.

Bernhard Hoetger - Zwischen den Welten,"Seine Bauwerke und Plastiken erregen heute noch Aufmerksamkeit, ihr Erschaffer ist jedoch nahezu vergessen: der Bildhauer und Architekt Bernhard Hoetger. Hoetger zählt zur Avantgarde des frühen 20. Jahrhunderts. Zahlreiche Mäzene kann er für sich gewinnen. So lässt Ludwig Roselius von ihm Teile der Bremer Böttcherstraße entwerfen. In Worpswede prägt er das Bild, das die Besucher heute mit dem Künstlerdorf verbinden. Hoetger verschlägt es Mitte der 1920er Jahre auf einen 'nordischen' Weg. Trotz seiner völkischen Ideen lässt Adolf Hitler die Werke Hoetgers als 'entartet' einstufen. In dem Film kommen Experten*innen und historische Weggefährt*innen (von Schauspieler*innen dargestellt) zu Wort, deren Schilderungen auf Originalzitaten der historischen Personen beruhen. So vermischen sich fiktionale Elemente mit dokumentarischen Aufnahmen, Archivmaterialien und Kunstwerken."

Emma is a typical housewife and mother of that time. This time of hardship is seen through her eyes and the Freeses' struggle for a life of dignity is followed. The war and its deprivations have left their mark on this generation, but now things are looking up again. But when her husband Alfred collapses ill at the Howaldtswerft shipyard in Kiel, Emma despairs. He has to take it easy, but how is the family supposed to get by without wages? This cannot go on. In October 1956, up to 34,000 metal workers in the shipyards and factories of Schleswig-Holstein went on strike in the fight for justice and dignity. To this day, this strike is considered the longest in Germany. Employers and politicians stood in the way of the strikers with decisive force. On the employer side of the then booming shipbuilding industry was shipyard boss A. Westphal. Julius Bredenbeck, Herbert Sührig and Hein Wadle are well-known trade unionists to this day, having orchestrated the strike and led it to success."

God Be with Us,"A film based on Bosko Tokin, a director of the first Serbian avant-garde film."
God Must Die,"* (God Must Die"" is inspired by Dostoyevsky's ""Notes from Underground"" and Nietzsche's ""God is Dead,"" This one-day odyssey follows Abram, a nomadic gypsy. Abram's path begins with a stark declaration: dragging a coffin through the streets, he proclaims, ""I have killed God!"" This attracts Fitna. His alarm brings media hounds and police, transforming a quiet day into a whirlwind. As chaos unfolds, Abram's past unfolds too. College students hack into his laptop, projecting his private discussions onto a live news channel. This unexpected audience witnesses philosophical debates about existentialism, nihilism, and the very origins of the concept of God. Beyond intellectual discourse, the film delves into humanity's darker side. The conversation shifts to the manipulative use of God's name to justify violence and discrimination based on color, creed, caste, and gender. Abram's act ignites a firestorm. He becomes a symbol, interpreted differently by various factions. Some see him as a Bad Guy, others as a liberator challenging oppressive doctrines. The narrative deftly weaves Abram's philosophical debates with the escalating external conflict. The film builds suspense, leaving the audience to wonder - what is Abram's true motive? Has he truly killed God, or is he a man desperate to awaken the world? ""God Must Die"" is more than just philosophical musings. It's a social commentary, urging viewers to confront the complex realities of faith, prejudice, and the search for meaning in a seemingly godless world. By the time the police raid Abram's home, he has vanished. His absence becomes a powerful statement, leaving the audience with lingering questions and no easy answers. Did he escape? Was he captured? )"

Huaquero,"On the northern coast of Ecuador, on Tolita Island, dozens of Afro-Ecuadorian children gather on the beach to collect Pre-Colombian artifacts that are scattered across the sand. They are all searching through the debris for pieces that they can somehow fix and sell to tourists on the mainland. Washo, a fifty-year-old unemployed fisherman, watches the children at their work while he recovers from a hangover. His fractured relationship with his daughter Yessica (6 years old) creates a distance between them. He leaves her with his ex-wife, who is upset with him for his irresponsibility as father. In the tropical heat of the night, Washo tries to fit the pieces of a clay figure back together like a puzzle. The scant catch of the season and the poor sales from his coconut grove only earn him enough to buy a bottle of moonshine and go out to the town's only bar on the makeshift docks, where the lights flicker thanks to the shortage of electricity. The alcohol and the precariousness of his life bring out his violent personality, which ends up permanently damaging his relationship with his daughter's mother. The sound of the waves breaking on the rocks of Isla DE la Plata (Silver Island) merges with the sounds of a boat from which Joselito (60 years old) descends. He is a native of the Ecuadorian coast and is dealing with the disappointment of the huaqueros (tomb raiders) who are complaining about the lack of results; they haven't found anything in the place where he suggested they excavate. Upon returning to the mainland, we can see how Joselito's museum has been destroyed by the recent earthquake. His brother urges him to sell all of his artifacts; thanks to the earthquake they need to rebuild their house and take care of their sick mother. But he refuses, confident that they will be able to find more pieces to sell. Excavating in another rural area of Valdivia, surrounded by a thick dry forest, an unexpected accident traps one of the huaqueros underground, and he suffocates to death. Impacted by the loss and limited by his lack of resources, Joselito sells off everything in his museum to a business magnate in the big city. After the deal is done, in which he practically has to give away his most valuable pieces for a laughable sum, he wanders through the city feeling lost, watching a backhoe digging a giant hole to build a new building. The trees begin to thin out in the arid landscape of Sipán, in northern Peru. Filo (50 year old) is talking to his lawyer who, through great legal maneuvering, has managed to get him out of prison, even though he has refused to admit anything about the robbery of El Señor DE Sipán (The Lord of Sipán), one of the greatest archeological finds in history, at the hands of huaqueros. After his time in prison Filo wanders like a ghost in his own home; his wife and son suffer the beatings of his depression, which has greatly deteriorated his relationship at home. He tries to support his family through his work in the sugarcane fields and in the little field of corn that he has beside the Mochica pyramid, where a great treasure was found years ago. But his efforts are in vain; the sugarcane company withholds his wages and he loses his own farm to an illegal fire. Tempted by necessity, he accepts the invitation of his friend who brings him to raid a tomb, insisting he knows the location of a new Moche treasure. Despite his wife's protests, he brings his son with him. After several hours of fruitless digging, a dozen police officers flood the camp and catch them red-handed. Once at the police station, Filo sees his lawyer again, who looks at him with disappointment when seeing that this time he has gotten his son involved. The desert spills infinitely in front of the ocean. The three giant pyramids of the archeological complex ""Huaca del Brujo"" (The Sorcerer's Tomb) pose motionless against the landscape. Juan helps his pregnant wife to gather mollusks at low tide. There is tension between them; what they earn will not be enough for what is coming next in their lives. At night Juan tries to catch crabs with his friends, but only manages to gather a few kilos. Roberto, an experienced huaquero from Magdalena DE Cao, Peru, invites Juan to help with a robbery. They walk together, posing as tourists as they examine the artifacts of the Sorcerer's Tomb, exploring its structure and its possible discoveries. At night, they approach the undefended tomb to excavate. But they are greatly surprised when, upon finding the treasure, a sun lights them up completely, turning the night into day. They escape with a few things and upon returning home, Juan finds his wife on the floor, covered in blood. Meanwhile Robert begins to have nightmares thanks to a crown of feathers he has stolen; in the morning, disturbed, he takes his motorbike and rides to the beach. Furiously he pours gasoline on all the loot and sets it on fire. He watches statically as everything burns in front of the ocean. ""Huaquero"" ventures down the South American coast, unearthing people and places that are apparently unconnected, but united by the precarious activity of selling archaeological artifacts from their ancestral cultures. Beginning in the lush equatorial jungle and ending in the desert landscape of the Peruvian coast, the film explores a masculinity torn apart by the necessity and the insanity of being forced to raid tombs in order to try to get ahead, and failing. The rural mood and its legends of the huaqueros filter throughout all the stories, and through the light that appears to leave them continuously in oblivion. The rawness of the documentation mixes with the fantasy of the mythological and poetic countryside, where it appears that the ancestors still speak of their pain through the holes inflicted on their sacred places, their ""huacas"" or tombs."

Kisum,"It's 4:00 a.m. in the restless heart of Lagos, and Kisum jolts awake - not from an alarm, but from the weight of the day ahead. Today isn't just another gig. It's the performance - the one he's been waiting for all his life. A showcase in front of the city's most powerful music industry figures, where one song could change everything. One night. One shot. One last hope. But there's a catch. To secure this coveted slot, Kisum made a desperate deal with the bar owner hosting the event. It's going to cost him five hundred thousand Naira - money he doesn't have. As the clock ticks, the pressure mounts, and Kisum must scramble to find a way, any way, to pay the price for his shot at destiny. Now 32, Kisum has been chasing the dream since he was 19. He sacrificed everything - friendships, security, and the approval of his conservative family - especially his father, a stern, once-proud man who saw music as rebellion and waste. Kisum's relentless pursuit of fame created a rift that never healed. And now, after 13 long years, his father is dying. At his mother's urging, Kisum visits home. The air is thick with unspoken pain. His mother, worn but wise, pleads with him to consider letting go - not just of the feud, but of the dream. She begs him to mend fences, to stop what she and his father see as a fruitless journey, and to return to the family's struggling business. Kisum resists - torn between the dream he's built his identity around and the reality he's lived with: late rent, missed meals, empty applause, and promises that never materialize. And yet, he can't walk away. Not yet. In a tender moment, he makes a promise to his mother: ""If I haven't made it by your next birthday, I'll give it all up. I'll come back. I'll fix things. I swear."" That promise sets the clock ticking. Today's performance becomes more than just a chance at success - it's a final act of defiance against failure, a desperate plea to prove that the last 13 years haven't been in vain. But the obstacles are many: the crushing cost of the show, unresolved tensions with his father, the growing burden of regret, and the quiet fear that maybe, just maybe, everyone else was right. As the day unfolds, Kisum must navigate betrayal, sacrifice, love, and loyalty - all of which will ultimately lead to a stage that may either redeem or destroy him."

Maya-The Truth,"""Maya-the Truth"" appears to be a compelling and thought-provoking film, delving into the themes of morality, consequences, and the human psyche. The story's focus on the protagonist's journey through his own past misdeeds and the eventual reckoning is a classic narrative about the inevitability of facing the consequences of one's actions. The film's exploration of the idea that ""the past can become the truth of tomorrow"" is particularly intriguing. This suggests a deeper commentary on how our actions, especially those we might want to forget or dismiss, have a way of defining our future. The character of Maya seems to be a catalyst for this revelation, forcing the protagonist, Arjun, to confront the truths he has long evaded. The performances, as described, seem to be particularly noteworthy. Mahi Zaal's portrayal of Maya is highlighted as a standout, suggesting a nuanced and powerful performance. Fahad Asad as Raj and Naina Gill as Khushbu, despite the latter's brief role, also appear to have delivered impactful performances. Director Naha Laj and writer Naeem Tahir seem to have created a film that's not just entertainment but also a medium for delivering a powerful message. The emphasis on the 'sensual animal inside man' and the disregard for the 'sanctity of relationships' points to a critical examination of human behaviour and societal norms."

Per il mio bene,"Giovanna inherited the family business from her father, which deals with the industrial (but artisanal) processing of natural stone. The woman does not have a partner, and although she maintains a close relationship with her mother Lilia and her 15-year-old daughter Alida, it seems that she is unable to build completely sincere bonds with them or to be completely transparent. So when she gets sick, she keeps the situation hidden from the girl, and only talks to her mother because she discovers that the only cure would be an urgent liver transplant from a blood relative in adulthood. But Lilia cannot help her, because... she is not her biological mother. Giovanna discovers that she was adopted and that she has lived a life in the dark about that important information regarding her identity. And she begins a search for her biological mother, the only one who could really save her life. 'Per il mio bene' is an unusual film in the Italian panorama because, despite starting from a melodramatic premise with a high risk of television (and the first scenes struggle a bit to find the necessary tone), it unfolds cinematically in a sober and calm way, working ""in levare"" and relying on the rigor of its protagonists: Barbora Bobulova in the role of Giovanna, Marie-Christine Barrault - a very welcome return - in that of her biological mother, Sara Ciocca in the role of Alida and Stefania Sandrelli in that of Lilia. Sandrelli performs an act of great generosity in leaving the more substantial role (which she could have easily played herself) to her French colleague: but with a couple of ""piercing"" expressions she lets Lilia's living pain filter through in witnessing Giovanna's rejection (and illness), as only a great actress can do. However, it is Barrault who towers over the big screen, beautiful in her lonely and angry old age, and Bobulova holds her own, with sweetness and a sense of deep affinity. Ciocca closes this quadrilateral of painful but loving relationships, letting all the adolescent need for truth and affective presence shine through. 'Per il mio bene' is a treatise on motherhood as the ability to act ""for the good"" of one's children, without sacrificing the right to one's own identity. The excellent screenplay by Monica Zapelli, Pierpaolo De Mejo and Mimmo Verdesca, clear and never insistent, avoids underlining and spares us useless explanations on what we have already understood, also because the images and the acting of the actresses (and actors: there is a splendid cameo by Leo Gullotta, also a very welcome return) speak for themselves, and clearly. Verdesca's direction, at his debut in fictional cinema after some documentaries and supported by the essential editing of Alessio Doglione, is careful and modest, and takes all the time and calm necessary to tell an adult story in which the elderly are finally treated with respect and realism, or as the complex people they have been all their lives - and who do not deserve to be reduced to a single note, mostly ridiculous, in favor of the younger audience (or cast). In a delicate moment of her life, Giovanna needs the person who abandoned her, her biological mother. The precision of the images, the ability to narrate a story full of emotion without ever bordering on gratuitous tears, make Verdesca welcome as a director of fiction, capable of ""working the natural stone"" that is cinema with grace and competence. A curiosity: the names of two of the protagonists seem to be homages to his previous documentaries, 'Alida' (on Valli) and 'In arte Lilia Silvi' (on the diva of white telephones). 'Per il mio bene' therefore appears as a (further) gesture of gratitude from a man towards the women he observes, and wants to tell, with discretion and solicitude."

Peter Brook's the Mahabharata (8K),"The Mahabharata unfolds in an ancient time in India, then known as Bharatavarsha. Two groups of cousins from the same royal family, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, vie for control of the Kingdom. Although descended from two brothers who live in peace, Dhritarashtra and Pandu, the cousins' rivalry leads to death and destruction and jeopardizes the very fabric of the universe. Born blind, Dhritarashtra, the elder brother, sits on the throne. His sons, the Kauravas, led by the ambitious and envious Duryodhana, seek to maintain their hold on power. In contrast, Pandu's sons, the Pandavas, led by the righteous Yudhishthira, seek to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs, and nothing more. The conflict between the two families intensifies over time, fuelled by jealousy, greed, and betrayal. The story weaves through a rich tapestry of events, including an infamous game of dice in which Yudhishthira loses his kingdom and freedom. The Pandavas find themselves in exile until their eventual return to fight and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. After years of tension and conflict, the only possible resolution is a battle of epic proportions, in which warriors of unparalleled strength destroy each other in a clash over the fate of the kingdom. Led by the noble Arjuna and guided by the divine Krishna, the Pandavas face off against their cousins, teachers, and friends on the battlefield. The war is not merely a clash of armies but a moral and philosophical struggle, testing in each person the principles of righteousness and duty. In the end, the Pandavas emerge victorious, but victory comes at a heavy price. The war leaves behind a trail of destruction and loss, leaving them and us to question the very nature of victory and the true cost of power."

Qadeesso (The Sacred),"Director Statement The story of Qadeesho, The Sacred, is centred around the Syrian Orthodox community, a minority community in South Central Kerala, India. Indian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox church based in Kerala, India. According to tradition, it originated in the missions of Thomas the Apostle during the first century AD. Growing up in a Syrian Christian community in South Kerala with devout family members, I was always left in awe by the vibrant colours and intricate designs present in Syrian Orthodox churches. The Liturgy held an enigmatic aura that captivated me from an early age. Influenced by the philosophy of Oriental Orthodox Christian Theology, I was an active participant in the church for the first 18 years of my life, instilling within me a strong devotion to Christ through regular attendance at Mass and other services, reading the New Testament, and a deep reverence for icons of Christ, the liturgy, prayer, scriptures, and the wisdom of the desert fathers. This religious influence clashes with the greed and Caste system of the Syrian Christian society in Kerala, as well as with contemporary political ideas. The main character, Priest Job, embodies the values of love and prayer. He is a non-judgmental person who is influenced by the writings of desert fathers and Iconography. In his village parish, Priest Job feels pressured by economic and social forces to conform to certain patterns. However, he rejects the practical belief that one must always choose what is most ""advantageous"" to oneself. Instead, he considers love and free choice the most important human qualities. Sunny, the brother of Job, possesses an exceptional intellect. However, despite his intellectual prowess, he finds it challenging to develop deep connections with others. His inability to love others and trust in the divine power of God often leaves him feeling isolated and disconnected from those around him. Job is a patient and attentive listener who prefers to let people express themselves without any pressure. He has a keen ear for their words and phrases, and his way of communicating is marked by clarity, colloquialism, and a touch of irony. Job firmly advocates for Elizabeth's love affair with a man from a lower caste, while sympathising with her situation as the sister of the wealthy Maj. Cherian. Rossamma finds genuine solace in confiding in the young monk, acknowledging that he has uplifted her soul from the depths of sorrow. Despite this, her family wrongly blames Job's argument with Rossamma for her tragic death. The film unequivocally portrays Job, a priest, reflecting on his personal and theological beliefs, including his doubts about the intensity of his prayer. Fr. Kuriakose, an older priest and retired seminary principal, serves as Job's mentor and guide. Job, amid his suffering, loses all desire to eat and struggles to find the strength to pray. However, in a moment of divine intervention, he witnesses a radiant light that overwhelms his senses and causes him to lose consciousness. Job is diagnosed with cancer in its early stages. The movie possesses a timeless quality and remains exceptionally relevant in today's social and political landscape. It delves into the intricacies of Christian life through the experiences of Job Abraham, as a powerful story of innocence and vulnerability, death and loss, and the mysticism of everyday life. Job boldly questions the inequalities of caste and class within the laity and firmly believes that the true meaning of hell is to give up on love. For Job, Christ serves as a personal inspiration for his suffering humanity and his transforming divinity, making it a truly remarkable cinematic experience. P.S. Qadeesho is a passion project filmed on a micro-budget with a dedicated and committed crew"

It tells the story of two close, brother-like friends-Addis and Girum-whose strong character and integrity are evident early in the film, but are later tested by the challenges they face as newcomers to Canada from Ethiopia. While Addis has already settled his immigration status and is somewhat established, Girum is still navigating major life hurdles, including his refugee protection process. The story begins on the day of Girum's refugee hearing, where he not only receives a rejection but also faces a painful setback in his romantic relationship. Amid this turmoil, the two friends are presented with an unexpected opportunity-one that tempts them to compromise their morals. Addis insists on staying true to their principles, while Girum, overwhelmed by his struggles, believes they should seize the chance regardless of whether it is right or wrong. This fundamental disagreement becomes the central conflict between them. Despite their differences, Addis remains loyal and protective, going to great lengths to shield Girum-even from the consequences of his own poor decisions.

Yathavkash,"Yathavkash Every year after graduation, lakhs of students from all corners of Maharashtra come to Pune to prepare for competitive examinations. The main reason behind this is that they do not get a job after getting a degree, but most of the students feel that they should get a government job. Students listen to the speech of an officer who has reached a high position through competitive examinations and get inspired by that speech and prepare for competitive examinations. Students begin to recognize the power, honor, and money that come after becoming an officer. Students dream of bringing a red beacon car to their doorstep. Since the importance of a government job is still unique in an ordinary middle-class family, the parents of the students are also willing to give the students as much time as they need to prepare for competitive exams. But competition is a tricky thing. Lakhs of students come every year to prepare for competitive exams, but no one sees how many of them pass and exit. The pass percentage of students is less than 1%. This means that 99.99 per cent of students fail the competitive exam every year. But still these students continue to study competitive exams for years without leaving the study of competitive exams. So if you look at it, you will notice that a student spends about eight to ten years studying for competitive exams. But even after spending so much time preparing for these exams, if these students couldn't get a job then what should those students do? The film tries to answer this question. The film teaches us to look at competitive exams only as exams and not make a life out of them. Every actor in the film is a student preparing for competitive exams. The students who have experienced the reality of competitive exams have dared to present that reality to the society through the film. This is a movie that every student should see. The hero of the film has come to Pune from his village to prepare for the competitive examination. The condition of the hero's house is very bad. The hero's mother sends the hero's monthly expenses by working in someone else's farm. Naik is also preparing for competitive exams with all his dreams. But even after all this, does the hero really succeed in the competitive exam? How does he deal with the challenges? What kind of support the hero gets from the hero's friends in all this time, we get to see in this film."
