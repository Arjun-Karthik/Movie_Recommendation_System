Alcala Norte at Bilbao BBK Live 2024,"Alcalá Norte is the missing link between Madrid and Manchester. The band unleash their post-punk energy on the Bilbao BBK Live Festival stage. Alcalá Norte was born in 2019 in the north-east of Madrid - the band's name is a direct reference to a shopping mall in the Ciudad Lineal district, so let's talk about local roots. Alcalá Norte seem to have everything it takes to become a future big name in Iberian music. Even Rosalía loves them. It's true that it's hard to resist their movida-influenced post-punk, a music both snarling and disillusioned that spawned a debut album soberly christened Alcalá Norte in April 2024. Alcalá Norte may have built up quite a reputation on social networks, but the six musicians don't forget to give it their all in the flesh. Their live performances have won over music critics, industry figures and post-punk fans alike. Now it's Bilbao BBK Live Festival's turn to succumb to the Alcalá Norte phenomenon.

Arcade Fire at Bilbao BBK Live 2024,"On stage at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival, Arcade Fire live up to their reputation as beasts of the stage. The Canadians take us on a journey of pure energy and poetry. It was in Montreal, in the early 2000s, that the multi-instrumentalist duo of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne gave birth to Arcade Fire. The result is one of the most fascinating pop bands of the last twenty years. The individual members of Arcade Fire are true virtuosos, able to switch from one instrument to another at the snap of a finger. At their explosively staged concerts, for example, it's not uncommon to see William Butler leap from keyboard to bass, while Richard Parry switches from toms to tambourine and Tim Kingsbury - the band's bassist and guitarist - improvises as a keyboardist... All this gives Arcade Fire's performances the air of an unbridled party, all set to an extravagant rock-baroque orchestration. This inventiveness and strong artistic bias (both live and in the studio) have been Arcade Fire's hallmarks since the very beginning. Many critics have hailed the band as ""the best live band in the world"". The great David Bowie even called the band members ""geniuses"". In 2018, at the Accor Arena, Arcade Fire delivered one of the finest performances ever filmed by our cameras. True to their reputation as a live beast, the Canadian band once again delivered a high-flying concert to the Bilbao BBK Live Festival audience. Filmed July 13, 2024 at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival, Spain."

El Columpio Asesino at Bilbao BBK Live 2024,"El Columpio Asesino is one of Spain's greatest krautrock bands.

El Columpio Asesino's music is indeed shifting and difficult to classify, drawing on krautrock, electro, post-punk... This great mix of genres produced six albums between 2003 and 2020 and, with them, a number of hits: ""Toro"", ""Ballenas Muertas en San Sebastián"", ""Babel""... The emotion was palpable at the BBK Live Festival, with many festival-goers eager to say goodbye to this cult band. Fortunately, thanks to ARTE Concert, this farewell can continue for several months after the Bilbao date. The magic of replay. Filmed on July 13, 2024 at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival, Spain."

"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk by Dmitri Shostakovich at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona","The main character is Katerina, a merchant's wife who, psychologically wiped out, bored with her husband and subjected to the tyranny of her father-in-law, is seduced by a depraved worker in the family factory, and ends up murdering first her father-in-law and then her husband, believing that by doing so she can achieve freedom. The new couple live together until a peasant accidentally discovers the crime, and reports it to the corrupt police of the time. The story ends with the murderous couple's deportation to Siberia. The pursuit of a dream that is short-lived: betrayed in the poverty of the escape that ends tragically. In Àlex Ollé's new production, Katerina, imprisoned in her bedroom, represents the ideal of a woman turned into a metaphor for an unattainable future of someone who is supposed to give life, but ends up being the source of death. A woman subjected to the traditional patriarchal system and trapped in an immutable family structure with female sexuality reduced to childbearing. We are talking, then, of an erotic rebellion as the first step in the search for a dream: individual freedom against the tyranny of the family. But this carnal passion is confused with love, love with surrender, surrender with submission and, finally, submission with sacrifice and the acceptance of suffering. Katerina is alone. With her wounded gaze and an identity to build, she shows herself through violence; killing is the only way out."

"Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona","1630-1640: Japan establishes the ""sakoku"" policy, which prohibits immigration and emigration to the country and strictly limits foreign trade: the only place that maintains trade relations with Europe is Dejima, an artificial islet in Nagasaki Bay. 1853: Japan is forced to open two ports for trade with the United States as a direct consequence of the Treaty of Kanagawa, ending centuries of Japanese foreign policy of isolation and closed borders. One of the effects of opening up Japan's trade was the emergence of a pronounced interest among Western artists in Japanese decorative arts, aesthetics, clothing and handicrafts. The Universal Exhibitions in London (1862) and Paris (1867) exhibited works by Japanese artists in Europe for the very first time. Artists such as Manet, Degas, Monet, Cassatt, Toulouse-Lautrec and van Gogh, among others, began to incorporate Japanese themes and designs into their own works: Japonisme was born. This interest in Japan helped make Pierre Loti's works a resounding success, including the novel Madame Chrysanthème (1887), one of the sources of inspiration for Madama Butterfly. The musical field was also influenced by Japonisme: Camille Saint-Saëns's opera La Princesse Jaune (1872), Gilbert and Sullivan's opera The Mikado (1885) and Sydney Jones's operetta The Geisha (1896) are just some examples. By adapting David Belasco's Madame Butterfly (based on a folktale by John Luther Long), which he saw in London in 1900, Puccini achieved a score that is both gargantuan and fascinating: a true masterpiece. He once again collaborated with librettists Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa (with whom he had already created La bohème and Tosca) to adapt the tragic story of Cio-Cio-San. Cio-Cio-San, the young Japanese bride of US naval officer Lieutenant Pinkerton, represents a broken dream: she believes she is embarking on a real marriage, but it is actually a short-lived romance, shattered when he abandons her shortly after they marry. She lives her life in the hope of his return; a tragic dream. She, who renounced her religion and community, learns too late that, for Pinkerton, her marriage is merely an illusion, with tragic consequences. Three years later, Cio-Cio-San and her son, Dolore, see Pinkerton's ship in the harbour. She excitedly awaits his visit, but when Pinkerton and his American wife Kate arrive and want to take the boy to America, Cio-Cio-San says goodbye to her son and takes her own life. Although the premiere at Milan's Teatro alla Scala in 1904 was poorly received, in the same year Puccini revised the opera for performances in Brescia. Madama Butterfly quickly became a very popular opera and remains one of Puccini's most beloved works. Leiser-Caurier's exquisite production is specifically inspired by the images of Japan in Europe during the 19th century. Sueña Yoncheva, Saioa Hernández and Ailyn Pérez will play the sad oriental heroine ready to sacrifice herself when faced with the cruel reality of betrayal."

Tangana, María José Llergo belongs to a generation of artists who take pleasure in modernizing and blending flamenco. The Cordoba-born musician fuses flamenco, hip-hop, pop and electro in a flamboyant combination of sensitivity, strength and melancholy. This music on the skin gave rise to the EP Sanación in 2020 and the album ULTRABELLEZA in 2023. This first full-length earned María José Llergo five nominations in the inaugural edition of the Academia de la Música de España, a competition launched in 2024 with the ambition of becoming the Spanish Grammys. Speaking of prestigious awards, María José Llergo also boasts a Goya for her song ""Te Espera el Mar"", featured in Marcel Barrena's film Mediterráneo. So it's one of the leading figures of the new Spanish music scene that we discover on stage at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival. Filmed on July 12, 2024 at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival, Spain."

He's keeping up in school, just made second chair saxophonist in his school's prestigious marching band, and is up for a coveted spot in the Chicago Youth Jazz Quartet. Sprinkle in a girlfriend that's way too hot for him and parents who are way too strict but solid, and he could almost forget the insane dreams he keeps having - the thing, neither human nor nonhuman, that keeps popping up in his life and even worse in his dreams. Kris is everything Miles isn't - rough, raw, and assertive, with his heart set on a rap career. When Kris moves into Miles' neighborhood, the two form a deep brotherhood, bonding over their love for music, and turning themselves into a two-man rap group. Kris gives Miles permission to grow up, while Miles gives Kris permission to dream. And when their first song goes mini viral on Soundcloud, the two promise to see it to the top together. But Miles' dreams get consistently worse - now he can see the figure, and he demands Miles make an impossible choice - to choose between saving the life of his girlfriend or that of his new best friend, Kris. When Miles decides not to decide, Kris dies suddenly. But, in reality, Kris has been dead the entire time. While Miles relived his friendship with Kris, working through his grief and wrestling with his image of God, his family and friends played along with his hallucinations on recommendation of his doctor. Miles faces off with the monster of his dream one final time, and realizes the choice of who lives and who dies was never his to make, but only his to learn to live with."

Shinova at BBK Live 2024,"Shinova bring their alternative rock to the Bilbao BBK Live Festival. This (almost) home concert gave the Basques the opportunity to present their album El Presente, released in 2024. Shinova was formed in 2008 in Berriz, in the Spanish Basque Country. Around singer Gabriel de la Rosa and bassist Ander Cabello, a quintet was formed, now featuring Daniel del Valle and Erlantz Prieto on guitars and Joshua Froufe on drums.

In 2017, Slowdive ended a 22-year hiatus with the release of their fourth album, soberly named Slowdive. Six years later, they did it again with everything is alive. A comeback applauded by critics and fans of dream pop and shoegaze alike. After welcoming them on stage at Echoes with Jehnny Beth, it's in a completely different setting that we find the members of Slowdive: the Bilbao BBK Live Festival, one of Europe's biggest festivals. But whether in front of a select audience or thousands of festival-goers, the Slowdive magic is the same. All you have to do is close your eyes for an hour of weightless flight. Filmed on July 13, 2024 at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival, Spain."

Wszystko to co mamy,"""All That We Have"" is a recording of an acoustic tour by Projekt Pudlo, the Szczecin-based punk rock band The Analogs, through penitentiaries and youth correctional centers in Poland. The main character of the film is the leader of The Analogs, Pawel Czekala, who takes us on an emotional journey through his life. During meetings with inmates, he often returns to his past, pointing out how powerful it is to believe in one's own dreams and to want to change one's life for the better. We also learn about Pawel's private life, the environment in which he grew up, and his views. Pawel repeatedly emphasizes in his statements how much his hometown has influenced his work. Many of The Analogs' song lyrics are about growing up and living in Szczecin, and the hopes and worries associated with urban existence. Projekt Pudlo is a very popular initiative on social media, and its reach far exceeds The Analogs' punk rock circles. In its simple message, it promotes universal values, faith in the others, a willingness to help and empathy for others."

And rather than choosing the comfort option, Zea Mays have opted for renewal without betrayal. When they take to the stage at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival, the musicians of Zea Mays can boast a discography of eleven albums, spanning the period from 1998 to 2022. The latest, Adore Kemena Kuraia, has a special place in the band's heart, as it was composed in response to Aiora's battle with cancer. An album full of ""courage and energy"" (as the title suggests), which the quartet performs to a rapt audience. Filmed on July 13, 2024 at the Bilbao BBK Live Festival."
