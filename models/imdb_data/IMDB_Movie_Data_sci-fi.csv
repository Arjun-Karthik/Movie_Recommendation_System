Parhelion,"CGI Burning Bushes, 10 Commandments by Download, Divine Intercom - What if It Was Aliens All Along? Parhelion shows-and-tells how the entire bible is but an unreliable record of extraterrestrial bioanthropologists doing fieldwork on Earth. A fierce sardonic agent provocateur (the writer-director) seduces audiences into a parable where the early Old Testament's sacred narratives and hallucinatory revelations are reframed as the meticulous observations of space-faring biologists and cutting-edge VR tech. Twinkle in eye, tongue in cheek, heart on sleeve, Bryson thus guides viewers through biblical lore, from alien-assisted advanced water hydraulics parting the Moses Red Sea to father-son duo Abraham (whose head is represented by a stop-motion animation American penny) and Isaac, unwittingly ensnared in a kin-selection experiment. Angels materialize as holographic projections from refurbished NASA public domain films, and divine proclamations echo through the cosmos as tannoy radio announcements with audacious flair. Yet beneath the veneer of whimsy lies a deeper interrogation of human belief and cosmic absurdity. As the monologues progress, the writer-director's demeanor shifts, her playful facade giving way to moments of poignant introspection. Behind the glib field report, the hallucinogenic paleo-animals, subversively reworked AI alien concepts and raw animations of Bryson's own UFO and nature paintings lies a profound sense of existential unease, a recognition of human spiritual fragility in the gorgeous vast expanse of the cosmos and, closer to home, on Planet Earth. A holy science project where ETs wear lab coats and enjoy mighty fine barbecue."
